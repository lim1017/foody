    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] hey guys it's Mike Chen I am in Toronto Canada you know this is a city I've been to many times before mainly to visit friends but I've never done a proper food tour here before I've always wanted to correct that because I noticed in the last few years there has been so many new and awesome looking Chinese restaurants popping up all over the city and I really want to try them all so this weekend my go is eat oh I dropped it since it's such a chilly day I thought we start the story with a nice hot bowl of noodle soup let's go first location homemade ramen I heard this is a play place for noodle soups and for cold scam you knows the code wheat noodles I like but unfortunately I just overheard they sort out of that it must be good because right now is like four o'clock and a sword out of cold noodles already so I'm really I'm sad but I'll move on so here I'm gonna go forward your traditional hand pulled ramen with beat now Chinese ramen is a lot different than Japanese ramen because in Chinese ramen where Lamia just hand-pulled noodles and that's what they specialize here so I'm gonna go forward the beef noodle choux the sesame pinky with sliced beef also come I I you know what let's just what a bunch of stuff see what happens everything is here this is perfect for a chili rainy day I'm just gonna dig right into my noodle soup what I love about this place is you can get your noodles as thin or as wide as you want it's like magical noodles so I got two bowls of noodles and for my soup noodle I got their classic beef noodle soup and I asked for the noodles to be as wide as it can be and there it is I can use these noodles as covers and the soup actually looks really clear usually the beef noodle soup I have the soup faces more soy sauce base let me just try the soup I really needed this I mean it was raining all the way here it's really cold outside and this thing hang on nothing warm my soul this church is subtly Alicia's is like you see a person without any fancy clothing without any makeup without any expensive jewelry but that person turn out to be like Jennifer Lawrence I never expected such a rich beefy flavor to come from such clear bra let me just try the noodles I wish my blinkers were made out of this and then each morning I just eat my way out I want to do I want to tuck this beat in tuck it in to this noodle I'm gonna like you know just make it a blanket and find my way through some broth we haven't even got to the best part yet because they got hot oil here so let's just put that in there this will be borderline divine little beef little noodle little radish we know it's that feeling is that feeling your home is raining outside you have the fire going in the fireplace you're on the couch with a warm blanket Forrest Gump is playing on TV you know is that kind of bite oh so good [Music] mm-hmm the noodles are everything I expected from hand-pulled noodles chewy really al dente and then noodles have been soaking in a soup for about five minutes now but still perfect again I'm really excited about stir-fried ramen usually when you stir-fry noodles you don't want it to be that thick that's why I got just a regular-sized noodles here they highly recommend this so I really thought that the last noodle will be the only noodle love of my life today but I was wrong this is really awesome I think I especially love the texture of these noodles so springy chewy look at this it's so elastic you see that spider Misha use this for its wet I get its lot less sticky but it's gonna be a lot more delicious it's gonna be a little more oily but you're gonna find that the more you chew the more the feelings gonna grow and I feel like this is gonna be a good compliment this is just pork belly and it's soaked in hot oil and fermented beans this caught me by surprise this is way better than I thought it was I thought there's gonna be a little overly oily and I thought it's gonna be a little one-dimensional but holy pigs this is delicious it's spicy obviously there's also Chinese vinegar in here to give it more acid in the fermented beans that gives this thing such a beautiful earthy flavor I was right this in the noodles there's gonna be a good match because the pork I feel like is it's gonna be the anti oral although it's for fat and covered in oil I still feel like it's gonna go really good with the noodles yeah this is really fantastic you know what I just thought of something take our noodles we're gonna dip it in this source I don't know why don't just make a dish with these noodles soaked in this sauce because I really feel like that needs to have it this is something I always get when they offer it this is a Chinese pork burger okay this one I'll tell you the truth doesn't look that impressive it's not very crispy on the outside so we'll see there's a little sweet let's not throwing me off is this dish is usually not sweet at all but the pork is nice and melty I love to push to be scallion it's not what I'm used to what's not bad this is something to have my eyes on the moment I walking or just see what's under here crispy whoa look how thin that sesame pancake is it's just delicately covering a flat bed of beef tendon on the inside there's some sort of sauce some cilantro I feel like it's a little sweet it needs something that's where neither problems don't the picking is good that's crispy on the outside it's so thin but it is a little overly sweet dip it in the sauce give a little more heat to come so much better I'm officially warmed up let's go to location number two location number two I am at the Pacific Mall Ashley love this place come here every time I'm in Toronto cool shops especially a great food court let's go check it out no what am i see skewers I don't know there's something about it just calls out to me you know so I got three lamb skewers and this is the first time I ever got lamb skewers with the chili on the side so let me just cover this and chili sure guys [Music] Wow that spiky wow that is good this is a really quality land store the meat is tender not gaming really clean flavor from that pepper I just finished this really delicious I'm burning up I mean this is 100% some of the tastiest lamb skewers I've ever had you can tell the difference in the first bike I'm dying right now good thing it's so spicy luckily I got something does that look really good to me this is matcha ice cream wrapped in crispy waffle and eat this desperately because I and my ton is on fire right now whoa this has been a stick just a waffle shelf man that is light and flaky let me make sure by the ice cream I just want this waffle oh my gosh okay I'm sorry I shouldn't collect the ice cream that's never nice and certainly never polite I have different feelings right now in my mouth I feel the relief from the ice cream because that killed off all the spice and also as delicious ice cream it looks so simple right just a waffle wrapped around a cream cheese ice cream but no it goes way deeper than that I was walking past this plays that sell fish balls and this look really good because they were dipping it in curry I got some fish balls and cuttlefish and I got some tripe that is poori ripken don't work whatever this sauce is amazing such strong curry flavor you know what make this even more awesome tell you guys it's right now I'm gonna take this fish ball dip it in the sauce and then dunk it and all that spice from the skewer I know this is gonna make me suffer and I'm out of ice cream but I don't think I can't not do this it's burning so good dog it hurts but it's a good kind of pain you know and the tripe this is one of my most favorite ingredients and hop on because of the surface is this grabs onto so much of that flavor all right it's just it just feels crunchy and satisfying the last thing I got here this is called simple gossip it's a very traditional Chinese crepe and I think with this we need to get a little messy look how thin this crepe is yellow is the egg mixed in with the crepe sesame seeds on top and on the inside typically they put a yo towel or a fried Chinese doll I think here there's a crispy pancake and I can also see like lot of scallions and just covered in sauce this is one of the most popular street foods in China just let that first tell you that if this is well you don't want it to be right in just one letter fantastic you know what I saw something else your take Josh I'm gonna take some tripe it's a bit of much I'm sorry I'm making a mess and I'm gonna put this tripe on the inside of my pancake I'm sorry if I'm grossing a buddy out but to me right now this seems really delicious why they give you gloves you weren't expected to play with your food don't knock Qatari try it I think it's pretty good this is another reason I love food courts because I really do feel like they kind of complement each other wrap it up with a bubble team and we're onto location number three last day in Toronto okay I've had a specific model day to our Toronto food to our first place I noticed a trophy okay when I see food places with trophies I want to know what they won for aunty leo and she makes Hong Kong milk tea ie told me her roti is the best it's not good she's not gonna make me pay for it should I well it is she said if I thought a bit place to better her Minds free as well chef batali okay I'm gonna have to try this milk tea okay auntie no tell me what makes the Hong Kong no tea a Hong Kong note is that they're different teas here it has to be at the right temperature the right don't do so aunty the old knows all that stuff and it's only here okay I'm excited it smells good I'll be honest with you auntie I like it I like it I'm not an expert on Hong Kong tea though because I don't know but that's he is very good like I I can taste the distinct tea flavor and that to me makes a good milk tea everybody you guys want to try come try y'all know my mom you know what Lu made little duck there's ice Hong Kong ability I wanna I wanna ice cover [Music] I like it mm-hmm oh it's really creamy oh I like this she's are you well what how much weight will help weaken I cannot resist see I'm food anywhere I go and this place in a new world mall this place in the Pacific Mall has some junkie and pork burger I can tell when a pork burger is good and I just buy from them from a glance and I've high hopes for this one look at it first of all pretend this is crispy on the outside looks like yep shots and gents on the inside war throughout that's a key thing for me I hate it when like you get a pork burger and the pork is somehow you know only concentrated on the northern hemisphere of the burger but this looks really even see that that's a clear sign that this thing is juicy the juice has made his presence on both sides of Earth and hold wheats evils that looks really spin you can tell this made in-house and this is cut by hand because it's all even on the sides if you have this as curtains for your bedroom you should feel embarrassed because people can see inside I'm gonna just mix this up a lot of sauce now just from looking at this I'm gonna guess this is gonna be like an eight point five or nine I think thousand nine point five congratulations Toronto you have a legit legit down peek cold noodle place right here in the Pacific Mall this is amazing and because it's thin every single shoes this has so much so much awesome sesame flavor I'm thinking this is gonna be really good show so excited this is Graham sorry sorry little overexcited really really sorry I I feel like taking on my form googling how to immigrate to Toronto this is amazing the pork it's just so no T little overly salty like it it's okay I like a lot of flavor I think if they could somehow make the make the bun a little more crispy on the outside this would be perfection right now it's already really good you know what don't change anything about yourself people you are Pacific Mall of all places I found some of the best young Chi and Chinese core burger I kid you not like probably in North America Oh come on oh I need to go back and see what else they have because wow this is good last day in Toronto well last few hours in Toronto but I really don't think I can leave Canada without stuffing my face with some poutine and looking at in places here I really wanted to go to this place called nom nom fatigue I look really good but since that doesn't open on Sunday I'm gonna have to go with the most common of poutine places smokes [Music] and looking at the poutine they look delicious goodbye I think he's this is the perfect analysis of anything that's healthy 1,300 is 1,400 calories it just keeps going up but some days you just got a splurge you know yeah three's a good number you're basically looking at a heart attack inbox delicious heart attack in boxes you guys never had poutine before it's basically rice or bread and cheese curds that's the regular poutine and this they take this up like 20 levels a lot of different meats cheeses look at this look how pretty does whatever I come to Canada I don't care what part of Canada got ads on poutine jig in I like to I like to just get a bite with everything nice all-inclusive bite look at that I go through different stages why don't you put team once in my first few bites world's good it's delicious I'm really happy if I bite six and set him oh you feeling a little less good about yourself in a cheeseburger one wall it's ground beef and cheese and of course always fake him seems one of those things that can make you feel really good and really bad at the same time and usually the more bites you take the worse you feel luckily I'm not there just yet it's like I'm eating a cheeseburger except for you know I'm just in a bunch there's fries and just an overabundance of cheese and bacon because it is so cheesy feel like need a little acid think a little vinegar is gonna help Michael it better the last one i watered this is a limited time special this is a Thanksgiving poutine it has all the trimmings cranberry sauce turkey stuffing gravy and it's dig into this of course lhasa cheese that is surprisingly good I think it's the cranberry sauce I kind of cuts through the salt a little bit and grab a piece with some stuffing you suck up Thanksgiving in there probably I favor out of the three I just can't put it down I kid you not I could get all three of these no wonder I take some pulled pork with some cranberry with some cheeseburger if you should just have a poutine what do you have everyone other things in there so this sort of happened I'm really not feeling too great about myself right now because I have a long drive ahead of me good I know this isn't like Chinese food we're supposed to be a Chinese retort but I had to wrap up my Canada trip with poutine I mean it just just had to happen anyway guys this has been such a fun trip now I know that the video sequencing of this trip is gonna be a little weird because this video is more like everything else I ate on this trip and there's a couple of videos about specific places I eat on this trip but overall Toronto what a great food city so much fun but guys that's it for the Canada fruit or so until we eat again ah see you later",
