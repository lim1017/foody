    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] hey guys it's Mike Chen I am in Toronto Canada you know this is a city I've been to many times before mainly to visit friends but I've never done a proper food tour here before I've always wanted to correct that because I noticed in the last few years there has been so many new and awesome looking Chinese restaurants popping up all over the city and I really want to try them all so this weekend my go is eat oh I dropped it since it's such a chilly day I thought we start the story with a nice hot bowl of noodle soup let's go first location homemade ramen I heard this is a play place for noodle soups and for cold scam you knows the code wheat noodles I like but unfortunately I just overheard they sort out of that it must be good because right now is like four o'clock and a sword out of cold noodles already so I'm really I'm sad but I'll move on so here I'm gonna go forward your traditional hand pulled ramen with beat now Chinese ramen is a lot different than Japanese ramen because in Chinese ramen where Lamia just hand-pulled noodles and that's what they specialize here so I'm gonna go forward the beef noodle choux the sesame pinky with sliced beef also come I I you know what let's just what a bunch of stuff see what happens everything is here this is perfect for a chili rainy day I'm just gonna dig right into my noodle soup what I love about this place is you can get your noodles as thin or as wide as you want it's like magical noodles so I got two bowls of noodles and for my soup noodle I got their classic beef noodle soup and I asked for the noodles to be as wide as it can be and there it is I can use these noodles as covers and the soup actually looks really clear usually the beef noodle soup I have the soup faces more soy sauce base let me just try the soup I really needed this I mean it was raining all the way here it's really cold outside and this thing hang on nothing warm my soul this church is subtly Alicia's is like you see a person without any fancy clothing without any makeup without any expensive jewelry but that person turn out to be like Jennifer Lawrence I never expected such a rich beefy flavor to come from such clear broth let me just try the noodles I wish my blinkers were made out of this and then each morning I just eat my way out I want to do I want to tuck this beat in tuck it in to this noodle I'm gonna like you know just make it a blanket and find my way through some broth we haven't even got to the best part yet because they got hot oil here so let's just put that in there this will be borderline divine little beef little noodle little radish we know it's that feeling is that feeling your home is raining outside you have the fire going in the fireplace you're on the couch with a warm blanket Forrest Gump is playing on TV you know is that kind of bite oh so good [Music] mm-hmm the noodles are everything I expected from hand-pulled noodles chewy really al dente and then noodles have been soaking in a soup for about five minutes now but still perfect again I'm really excited about stir-fried ramen usually when you stir-fry noodles you don't want it to be that thick that's why I got just a regular-sized noodles here they highly recommend this so I really thought that the last noodle will be the only noodle love of my life today but I was wrong this is really awesome I think I especially love the texture of these noodles so springy chewy look at this it's so elastic you see that spider Misha use this for its wet I get its lot less sticky but it's gonna be a lot more delicious it's gonna be a little more oily but you're gonna find that the more you chew the more the feelings gonna grow and I feel like this is gonna be a good compliment this is just pork belly and it's soaked in hot oil and fermented beans this caught me by surprise this is way better than I thought it was I thought there's gonna be a little overly oily and I thought it's gonna be a little one-dimensional but holy pigs this is delicious it's spicy obviously there's also Chinese vinegar in here to give it more acid in the fermented beans that gives this thing such a beautiful earthy flavor I was right this in the noodles there's gonna be a good match because the pork I feel like is it's gonna be the anti oral although it's for fat and covered in oil I still feel like it's gonna go really good with the noodles yeah this is really fantastic you know what I just thought of something take our noodles we're gonna dip it in this source I don't know why don't just make a dish with these noodles soaked in this sauce because I really feel like that needs to have it this is something I always get when they offer it this is a Chinese pork burger okay this one I'll tell you the truth doesn't look that impressive it's not very crispy on the outside so we'll see there's a little sweet let's not throwing me off is this dish is usually not sweet at all but the pork is nice and melty I love to push to be scallion it's not what I'm used to what's not bad this is something to have my eyes on the moment I walking or just see what's under here crispy whoa look how thin that sesame pancake is it's just delicately covering a flat bed of beef tendon on the inside there's some sort of sauce some cilantro I feel like it's a little sweet it needs something that's where neither problems don't the picking is good that's crispy on the outside it's so thin but it is a little overly sweet dip it in the sauce give a little more heat to come so much better I'm officially warmed up let's go to location number two location number two I am at the Pacific Mall Ashley love this place come here every time I'm in Toronto cool shops especially a great food court let's go check it out no what am i see skewers I don't know there's something about it just calls out to me you know so I got three lamb skewers and this is the first time I ever got lamb skewers with the chili on the side so let me just cover this and chili sure guys [Music] Wow that spiky wow that is good this is a really quality land store the meat is tender not gaming really clean flavor from that pepper I just finished this really delicious I'm burning up I mean this is 100% some of the tastiest lamb skewers I've ever had you can tell the difference in the first bike I'm dying right now good thing it's so spicy luckily I got something does that look really good to me this is matcha ice cream wrapped in crispy waffle and eat this desperately because I and my tongue is on fire right now whoa this has been a stick just a waffle shelf man that is light and flaky let me make sure by the ice cream I just want this waffle oh my gosh okay I'm sorry I shouldn't collect the ice cream that's never nice and certainly never polite I have different feelings right now in my mouth I feel the relief from the ice cream because that killed off all the spice and also as delicious ice cream it looks so simple right just a waffle wrapped around a cream cheese ice cream but no it goes way deeper than that I was walking past this place that sell fish balls and this looked really good because they were dipping it in curry I got some fish balls and cuttlefish and I got some tripe that is poori ripken don't work whatever this sauce is amazing such strong curry flavor you know what make this even more awesome tell you guys it's right now I'm gonna take this fish ball dip it in the sauce and then dunk it and all that spice from the skewer I know this is gonna make me suffer and I'm out of ice cream but I don't think I can't not do this it's burning so good dog it hurts but it's a good kind of pain you know and the tripe this is one of my most favorite ingredients and hop on because of the surface is this grabs onto so much of that flavor all right it's just it just feels crunchy and satisfying the last thing I got here this is called simple gossip it's a very traditional Chinese crepe and I think with this we need to get a little messy look how thin this crepe is yellow is the egg mixed in with the crepe sesame seeds on top and on the inside typically they put a yo towel or a fried Chinese doll I think here there's a crispy pancake and I can also see like lot of scallions and just covered in sauce this is one of the most popular street foods in China just let that first tell you that if this is well you don't want it to be right in just one letter fantastic you know what I saw something else your take Josh I'm gonna take some tripe it's a bit of much I'm sorry I'm making a mess and I'm gonna put this tripe on the inside of my pancake I'm sorry if I'm grossing a buddy out but to me right now this seems really delicious why they give  you gloves you weren't expected to play with your food don't knock the tripe try it I think it's pretty good this is another reason I love food courts because I really do feel like they kind of complement each other wrap it up with a bubble team and we're onto location number three last day in Toronto okay I've had a specific model day to our Toronto food to our first place I noticed a trophy okay when I see food places with trophies I want to know what they won for aunty leo and she makes Hong Kong milk tea ie told me her roti is the best it's not good she's not gonna make me pay for it should I well it is she said if I thought a bit place to better her Minds free as well chef batali okay I'm gonna have to try this milk tea okay auntie no tell me what makes the Hong Kong no tea a Hong Kong note is that they're different teas here it has to be at the right temperature the right don't do so aunty the old knows all that stuff and it's only here okay I'm excited it smells good I'll be honest with you auntie I like it I like it I'm not an expert on Hong Kong tea though because I don't know but that's he is very good like I I can taste the distinct tea flavor and that to me makes a good milk tea everybody you guys want to try come try y'all know my mom you know what Lu made little duck there's ice Hong Kong ability I wanna I wanna ice cover [Music] I like it mm-hmm oh it's really creamy oh I like this she's are you well what how much weight will help weaken I cannot resist see I'm food anywhere I go and this place in a new world mall this place in the Pacific Mall has some junkie and pork burger I can tell when a pork burger is good and I just buy from them from a glance and I've high hopes for this one look at it first of all pretend this is crispy on the outside looks like yep shots and gents on the inside war throughout that's a key thing for me I hate it when like you get a pork burger and the pork is somehow you know only concentrated on the northern hemisphere of the burger but this looks really even see that that's a clear sign that this thing is juicy the juice has made his presence on both sides of Earth and hold wheats evils that looks really spin you can tell this made in-house and this is cut by hand because it's all even on the sides if you have this as curtains for your bedroom you should feel embarrassed because people can see inside I'm gonna just mix this up a lot of sauce now just from looking at this I'm gonna guess this is gonna be like an eight point five or nine I think thousand nine point five congratulations Toronto you have a legit legit down peek cold noodle place right here in the Pacific Mall this is amazing and because it's thin every single shoes this has so much so much awesome sesame flavor I'm thinking this is gonna be really good show so excited this is Graham sorry sorry little overexcited really really sorry I I feel like taking on my form googling how to immigrate to Toronto this is amazing the pork it's just so no T little overly salty like it it's okay I like a lot of flavor I think if they could somehow make the make the bun a little more crispy on the outside this would be perfection right now it's already really good you know what don't change anything about yourself people you are Pacific Mall of all places I found some of the best young Chi and Chinese core burger I kid you not like probably in North America Oh come on oh I need to go back and see what else they have because wow this is good last day in Toronto well last few hours in Toronto but I really don't think I can leave Canada without stuffing my face with some poutine and looking at in places here I really wanted to go to this place called nom nom fatigue I look really good but since that doesn't open on Sunday I'm gonna have to go with the most common of poutine places smokes [Music] and looking at the poutine they look delicious goodbye I think he's this is the perfect analysis of anything that's healthy 1,300 is 1,400 calories it just keeps going up but some days you just got a splurge you know yeah three's a good number you're basically looking at a heart attack inbox delicious heart attack in boxes you guys never had poutine before it's basically rice or bread and cheese curds that's the regular poutine and this they take this up like 20 levels a lot of different meats cheeses look at this look how pretty does whatever I come to Canada I don't care what part of Canada got ads on poutine jig in I like to I like to just get a bite with everything nice all-inclusive bite look at that I go through different stages why don't you put team once in my first few bites world's good it's delicious I'm really happy if I bite six and set him oh you feeling a little less good about yourself in a cheeseburger one wall it's ground beef and cheese and of course always fake him seems one of those things that can make you feel really good and really bad at the same time and usually the more bites you take the worse you feel luckily I'm not there just yet it's like I'm eating a cheeseburger except for you know I'm just in a bunch there's fries and just an overabundance of cheese and bacon because it is so cheesy feel like need a little acid think a little vinegar is gonna help Michael it better the last one i watered this is a limited time special this is a Thanksgiving poutine it has all the trimmings cranberry sauce turkey stuffing gravy and it's dig into this of course lhasa cheese that is surprisingly good I think it's the cranberry sauce I kind of cuts through the salt a little bit and grab a piece with some stuffing you suck up Thanksgiving in there probably I favor out of the three I just can't put it down I kid you not I could get all three of these no wonder I take some pulled pork with some cranberry with some cheeseburger if you should just have a poutine what do you have everyone other things in there so this sort of happened I'm really not feeling too great about myself right now because I have a long drive ahead of me good I know this isn't like Chinese food we're supposed to be a Chinese retort but I had to wrap up my Canada trip with poutine I mean it just just had to happen anyway guys this has been such a fun trip now I know that the video sequencing of this trip is gonna be a little weird because this video is more like everything else I ate on this trip and there's a couple of videos about specific places I eat on this trip but overall Toronto what a great food city so much fun but guys that's it for the Canada fruit or so until we eat again ah see you later",

    "transcript": "[Music] hey good morning guys the Toronto food tour continues to the next day I am at the dragonballs fusion cuisine I found this place a few years ago accidentally I came here I tried the food and I couldn't stop thinking about it ever since this place is known for their dim sum and I got here 30 minutes before it opened and just look at the line another thing that sets this place apart than any other dim sum place I've been to it's not only the fact that it tastes good the dim sum offerings they are ginormous and I love the fact that they have recommended items here that says you must eat it now you might consider me a food sucker but when a restaurant says I need to try something then I'm gonna try it so let's get started wow this says tens how do you bought the number one bun in the world hopefully it is let's get the show mine see if you're looking for camping a lot of here it's sure thing spareribs matera sounds good oh love this Suja oh this is vegetarian yes sure why not I just water it I think a lot more than I can eat which is pretty much always the case and I'm filled with anticipation you know you know how like you haven't seen an old friend for a long time we're picking her or him up at the airport he's kinda like you get the jitters and I'm saying I'm gonna some dump some jitters first thing that came I wasn't really expecting this to come first and it's kind of an odd item to begin my my dim sum meal with this is deep-fried durian puffs kind of oh oh it broke already I did not mean to do that I'm gonna smell this you got to do that during a smell test it does not smell that bad it just smells like durian - the stick it looks really custardy I'm thinking this is gonna be pretty good this might be the first time in my life I didn't need a drink of water right after eating durian the stink is basically gone it's just a premie sweet delicious torreón custard who's been touched it this is really sweet but luckily and dump something doesn't really matter what you need first you can eat savory items first where you can use sweet items first it doesn't really matter so great start to this meal the food is coming in and first of all I love how they put this in like a little square box that's pretty bruised a savory item is black bean spareribs one of my favorite dim sum items I love black bean sauce one of my all-time favorite Chinese sauces you don't need a dip doesn't anything well not hot this place there's no cars being pushed around which is a shame because it's more fun but at the same time this is cooked or water piping hot nice black bean flavor a little sweep a nice and tender rich next up this looks really intense I'm a little intimidated it just looks like a big food ball did I like sign up for food baseball without knowing or something this is the sauce it came right oh it's all simple sighs this is a pretty intense shrimp ball I mean look at this it is snappy and chew chew - ribbets girl look at the cheese point out of that I love how they covered it with the armor of almonds and one thing this has to be to really work is that the shrimp has to be fresh and yeah this is just definitely fresh never had grouper and a dim sum before good well ginger black bean sauce got some nice spice from the chilies nice and tender meat now this is really unique it's something I never seen before this is shrimp dumpling in soup very clear not a lot of spices I taste a lot of the spring onions very shuttle shoot I'm digging through one of these dumplings wow this is really springy it's like cutting a shrimpy bouncy ball and you can see like it's harsh shrimps in here whoa I was kind of expecting this wrapper to be I don't know it's falling apart because I got almost a mochi a scrapper the wrapper is soaked the wrappers made out of fish cakes oh okay put a shrimp into a fish cake it made that into a dumpling one of the best things I had so far it definitely needs some hot oil to go inside for sure what thank you my discreet comment it's like a food battle wave after which I guess that makes me a food warrior no really good definitely good dish this is a very common dim sum item to show might now the thing that makes this place kind of different is look at the size of this I think a typical show mine is like half the size this is a shawl nice dad like you see although each year these will eventually become little baby sha my Kurian it's like a bow give this a little hot oil first wife couldn't fit my mouth around it the size does not take away from the flavor this is BBQ rolls pork rice noodles and there's little DIY aspect to this where I get to pull my own soy sauce a little soy sauce waterfall I don't know if I'm supposed to pour all of it I'm gonna try to cut this in half get a better look at what's inside write your notes on my favorite dim sum dishes so lights and Shoei looks like it's stuffed with roast pork see some taro scallions dip this into soy sauce I always like to give it a little more hot oil I love this I really look look how it's just overflowing with me this is my kind of rice you know we got to do this again if you couldn't tell I really enjoy it out now I had to get two orders of the rice noodles because this is really unique I've never seen this before it's steamed duck rice noodles with seaweed and the soy sauce they give you is warm you don't need too much they give you a lot of soy sauce I see a lot of duck fat some seaweed oh well chase good the controversy we is a nice contrast to the chewy noodles themselves I couldn't really taste much of the duck and I think it's because there's only duck skin and duck fat I really wished it would actually add the duck meat itself in here I think that will make this a lot better a tart and this is little paler than the typical egg tart I've encountered in my life but that's great that's fantastic as a good egg tart Wow all the good signs of egg tart are here buttery flaky but that creamy Center oh it's like this ink tour just walked up to me and gave me the chance list but the warmest of hunks has a winner the chicken feed is a quintessential dim sum food item I feel like this might be one of the most adventurous things on a dim sum menu and if you never had it I encourage you to try it because this is a classic and there's no pretty way to you dish it's got uh putting your mouth I love Dutch now it is an acquired taste its gelatinous is little tendon II but trust me once you acquired this chase this thing will be running through your mind all day long and get it chicken feet running you know something else that's really new for me oxtail at a dim sum a lot of oxtail I mean they might kill like four cows for this Oh oh yeah if you like to be get this good doesn't them some I feel like dim sum doesn't really have a lot of beef items there's usually the beef short rib and I think that's about it but this it punches you in the face with a beefy flavor right for chakra and this part it was my favorite this is like 80% tender right here mmm let's go tendon yeah yeah get rough with them use your bullish strength if you will you know what people look at me weird I don't even care this is so good something else is different it's a steamed seafood with lotus root dumpling the name is really pretty in Chinese it's called like she means war which is a mystical beast fruits I don't know it looks good it's wrapped in seaweed and it's kind of like a sushi roll yeah it tastes like a Shum I met a sushi roll they had a baby and then this baby decided to just eat a lot of little shoots so if you like Shammai and you like sushi and you like Lotus this is your dish yes we're nearing the end of this dim sum me up I got something to show you this is a balanced meal in a cage I never thought I would ever say that in my life but here it is I don't even know where to start with this alright this is you know chicken feet pickled chicken feet this might be scary to some of you because it's really pale I promise you not as bad as you think really good actually oh really come this texture is gonna be almost completely different than the soy sauce chicken thing from before is almost more crunchy its marinated in white wine Chinese rice wine Bob I'm get drunk eating one of these I'm curious about these things here don't see a lot of beans only Chinese dishes these smells like soy beans Wow three our judiciously sweet soy beans definitely somepony here I was kind of worried about this because it resembled that the Japanese stinky beans you know I'm talking about but this is delightfully sweet it's fantastic now I'm really excited about this this looks like a papaya with coconut jelly on the top and it's a papaya with coconut jelly on the top well that was refreshing oh this is strange this is like wow check it out really indestructible just like a red bean jelly sandwich I mean red bean and Kevlar jello sandwich I love that it give you a whole new baton this is why I like meet you more oh this is this will be my daily serving of fruits last item of the meal and probably the one I'm most excited about first of all let me get everything out of the way because it needs to make a great entrance it really does and I'm gonna call it in it's ready it's such a cute with what looks like runny eggs but it's not everything here it's fruits you see what I'm so excited it's so pretty right let me get chicken honey okay enough hug now I eat it that's kind of terrifying is like the worst food nightmarish horror movie ever and check this out I think it's also a cookie it's a cookie and don't hate me I feel like the only logical way here to take a small bite his butt off his head it's a sugar cookie it's a sugar cookie and this is the most exciting part of this dish yeah it looks like a raw egg but it's winter melon paste and coconut mango jelly I wonder just gonna pop it looks like it could pop let's pop it I'm a little afraid oh let me taste a little bit that's Mingo it's like Mingo juice and I'm gonna scoop some that mango juice and this is the coconut jelly right now even up to now this still looks like an egg right it was like an egg yolk egg right this is subtly delicious lightly sweet chilli is delicate I think this was the best way to cap up this meal I mean a lot of dim saw some little oily some savory some sweet and then just this beautiful light delicate refreshing egg husband tastic try this we know what joke what oh wait oh research what is company right now oh my god oh good god oh that I would've died okay line oh wow I did not say that I did not that was legit here you saw on my face like I was mentioning I'm all dims I'm done nobody come near me anytime some worker comes near me I'm scared right now by the way guys I got a lot of hot oil because you know so you can see from my shirt I'm powered by hot oil I run in this stuff so if you are powered by hot oil as well go get your hot oil shirt we're dumping sugar more juice or whatever you want our store is lie the link is in the description box below so we it again I'll see you later I'm gonna get a chicken one whole chicken dare me right now",

    "transcript": "[Music] this is by far one of the most beautiful places that ever been to my life and this hotel supposedly has an awesome breakfast buffet let's go check it out I've heard a lot of good things about this breakfast buffet just after a quick glance there's a lot of stuff here let's go take a look starting out there's tons of cuts cheeses there's Indian food threads bagos smoked salmon there's a Mexican station with tortilla beans pole pork tamales traditional breakfast offering like roasted potatoes sausage scrambled eggs and that's just half the breakfast buffet there's all sorts of juices smoothies bacon sausage roast pork and glazed ham there's salads yogurts oh my gosh look at all the pastries muffins croissants danishes [Music] and what breakfast wouldn't be complete was some hot chocolate and all the toppings you could possibly want then the desserts continue with puddings cakes different flavors of ice cream and look at this a popsicle station cereal of course there's french toast pancakes steamed mackerel what they're stewed conk sheep tongue grits Johnny cake more fruits omelet station and dim some there's coni there's chicken noodle soup spring roll steamed buns this might be one of the most loaded all you can Buffet I've seen outside of Vegas this breakfast sandwich looks gooey mey and delicious Some Cuts get some pami never had this cheese before breakfast round one this looks like a salami cheese croissant sandwich I'm just going to add some pami and some of the spicy hummus oh yeah I've been starving since about 4:00 this morning and this is such a satisfying bite by the way this Buffet opens at 7:30 in the morning with all the stuff you see here buttery croissants loaded with meat cheese add some of the spicy hummus for a bit more of meat oh this cheese is so creamy smoked sandwich delicious I am so excited for my tamali this is actually a really good tamale stuffed with pork it's soft moist a little grainy nice gentle sweetness from the Masa texture flavor that's a pretty good [Music] SMY round two got myself a very loaded breakfast taco stuff with barbecue pork guacamole salsa and cheese that is one tender tender melting your mouth shredded barbecue pork that thing is Juicy sweet Smoky guacamole is creamy salsa got a good amount of heat that's a very solid breakfast taco what I'm really excited is to try that local Bahamian food section and also all those crazy breakfast desserts local food [Music] first all right I got some steam Mac roll some stewed conk sliced ham and Rose pork which might have been a mistake yeah it looked kind of dry when she was slicing it and it tastes like it looks that tastes drier than a plet of Tatooine this is really exciting steamed mackerel and it had a bowl of chilies on the side M that is really really good especially if you add the chili sauce which is made with Scotch Bon and peppers one one of my favorite peppers in the world the macro is Savory a little sweet very juicy and ginger they put a lot of local herbs and spices in here as well I think this is freaking awesome conk stew look at this giant pieces of conk potatoes carrots I put Scotch bonnet peppers in here as well as the chef recommended that I do W this is freaking outrageous and the flavor of the stew is very deep as Savory this thing is very thick and Rich the Kong has a very mild slightly sweet slightly griny taste to it I think it tastes very close to a giant razor clam in every bite you get this aromatic warmth that comes from the stew that just spreads through your body and the savoriness of the stew really compliments the sweetness of the conk and the scotch Bonet sauce that they had it adds a lot of acidity to cut into the richness of the stew and of course giant chunks of conk in the stew and it's really inter inter when you chew the conk at first you get all the blend of spices and flavors from the stew at the end though all you're tasting is the sweetness of the conk it's really amazing I love it my favorite thing on the buff right now they give you a little container for the syrup I just filled it up with Scotch Bon and chili sauce this is another very traditional local dish sheep's tongue sauce so stewed sheep tongue I don't think I've ever had sheep's tongue before oh look at this this is some gnarly stuff besides the skin and the Meer some cartilage in here as well wow some celery onions carrots the broth is very citrusy let's try a sheep's tongue that is a crunchy crunchy tongue I've had a lot of um animal tongue in my day I've never had a crunchy one before I like it the tong flavor itself is very mild is meaty nothing gamey about this at all the crunchy car kind of reminds me of a pigier I think that's because the base of the sheep Tong the connective tissue has some carage in there yeah the Sheep Tong is my favorite part celer is nice and crunchy as well like Johnny cake is really up this thing is really fluffy also sweet and buttery I like that a lot go get more conks to Stew is my favorite thing I definitely feel like it's much better plus you add some scotched bed pepper it goes from great to incredible also got some crispy bacon a bite of kungu cheese it with a bite of crispy bacon a little additional fatty crunch with the Kung Stu that's a pretty great combo dessert time I got a Danish a cheese croissan some P clada ice cream at 8 in the morning and a carot cake I don't know if this restaurant bakes their own pastries this is freaking amazing crispy flaky butter very sweet absolutely perfect it sounds not bad either carrot cake is good ice cream is fantastic like I said this is definitely one of the most loaded breakfast buffets I've ever been to pretty much whatever you're craving for breakfast whether it's cereal pastries pancakes omelets Indian Chinese Mexican local food it's all there oh actually there one more thing I want to get for breakfast right actually two more things but get this one first I really love this macro but I wanted it with some starch so I made a steamed mackerel Taco oh so good this has definitely been one of the best breakfast Buffs I've been to in a long while pretty much something for everybody if you are ever in the Bahamas highly recommend of course got to leave with the popsicle well that's it for my time here in the Bahamas I'm going to head off to Toronto for a few days so see you guys over there [Music] that's a beautiful rainy day here in Toronto every time I come to Toronto got to get some Chinese food the Chinese food scene here I think it's the best in North America and this place I haven't been to yet this place is called sh this looks as authentic as they come [Music] down PE cold wheat noodles oh I miss those crunchy Sprouts noodles are so bouncy and chewy chewy sauce soaking gluten I wish I could have got one of each item on the menu I got a lot of stuff though when you get L PE you got to get the pork burger this thing looks like has a lot of juice inside nice big fatty chunks stuffed with meat the bun is nice and toasty on the outside this SP is really really good this is absolutely phenomenal why you invite into this the pork is like a waterfall of juice Savory fatty mamy fill the juice the bun is deliciously toasty on the outside perfect little Crunch and I saved my yum PE leftover sauce to dunk this in cuz that is just is how you're supposed to eat this absolutely perfect this is the cumin beef with chilies this looks really good as well tastes like what I had in China the meat they're using is fatty beef which is not traditional but the perfect use of cumin and chilies are so good of course split a good CA meal without some B noodles and here they give you some Bok Choice some tomatoes and eggs and some minced beef beautiful chew tomatoes and eggs and noodles a little sweet eggy this thing is very meaty as well super Saucy noodles with just the most perfect texture and make sure to add some hot oil to this little vinegar mix that [Music] in even better bam B noodles my favorite noodles in the world one last dish I got pork dumplings and sour soup soup is super vegr dumping and fatty and juicy it's just a perfect combination I like to make it really really vinegary and very spicy this is the perfect meal for rainy day to me this is just the most ultimate Chinese comfort food feel like I I've scratched a craving itch today that has been there for a long long time this place is absolutely phenomenal after some noodles let's go grab some tacos these are really really interesting I'm here with nine and Rishi and you guys created some really unique tacos tell us about it you know we wanted to make our own twist on it so they're South Asian inspired tacos rather than tortillas we use a homemade nun and we have like buttered chicken or beef Kebab our gold Curry I'm so excited to try this I love trying out new Innovative Foods Indian taco never had that before for Buttered chicken the tortilla is a homemade grilled nut perfectly toasted by the way it looks to be beautifully puffy and Airy nicely charred on the Outside Inside Saucy buttered chicken crispy onion cilantro sour cream sauce and cheese this is freaking ridiculous this is not as simple as putting butter chicken inside a toast and non from texture to flavor very carefully thought out and you taste that meticulous food planting there taste tastes like a taco first of all every single element of this just screams delicious the nun is perfectly Airy wonderfully toasty on the outside this thing is buttery as garlicky pretty much melts in your mouth and then when you bite into it you get that Saucy butter chicken it's Rich it's creamy it's citrusy and that crunchy onion is genius in here I love that little bits of crunch and when you're eating it it satisfies both your Indian food craving and your taco craving kids you not yeah I'm trying one of every Taco this is the devil shrimp looks like some cabbage carrots cilantro cheese over prawns the paneer with their signature lime cilantro sour cream this is the beef Kebab there's some tomatoes lettuce and some spicy mayo on top and finally goat let's try this Devil's shrimp as soon as you grab the taco in your hand that overwhelming Aroma of butter and garlic and Char just oh overwhelms you this is so ridiculous beautifully tender shrimp I think some sauteed onions in there as well to provide a hint of sweetness refreshing crunch from the Cabbage again the awesome buttery garlicky non shell ton of heat giant shrimp inside that are plump and juicy bite into that you get some of that sweetness as well that one might be my favorite the heat the flavor everything thing it's pretty much intoxicating this is the [Music] paneer this might be the richest one and if you love paneer you will absolutely adore this one bite you get that awesome nutty paneer at the same time wonderful crunch again from the fried onions the flavor is intense it's balanced and all you want to do is just take another bite this one is so buttery and cheesy again with that delicious citrusy lime sauce that cuts through the richness and that just highlights that NY flavor of the cheese three tacos down this has definitely been a roller coaster flavor every single Taco is way different than the other let's try the beef Kebab next yeah every single Taco so distinctively different and one more delicious than the next this thing is great needy with a refreshing sweet pot from the Tomato loaded with spices and heat Kebab is is perfect it's got a nice Smoky Char flavor to it the spicy Meo is creamy lettuce and tomatoes little bit of a refreshing break from the Heat and really just enhances the flavor of the Kebab I think that one might be the most flavorful one I'm really looking forward to this next one this is goat cilantro lime [Music] sauce wow that goat is delicious all sorts of different spices the meat itself incredibly tender and juicy and all that sauce and spices it's a steeped into the none good amount of heat in here as well it taste the smokiness of the cumin the coriander it's just one of the most flavorful tacos you will ever eat no gaminess all the spices just works with the go so well I definitely recommend if you come here get these piping hot from the kitchen so the N is toasty and all the spices are singing that is the best way to enjoy this this is such a unique concept I've never heard of Indian tacos before and if you are a fan of Indian food or a fan of tacos highly recommend trying this place out this will leave you feeling So Satisfied and hooked and it left me absolutely stuffed and a perfect ending to the short but awesome food day I'll be thinking about this for a while oh actually they also have dessert a little Biscoff cheesecake buttery crumbly that is a perfect ending to this awesome food there as always all the places I went to listed down below for you thank you all so much for watching until we eat again see you later",
