    "transcript": "hahaha one of them's buddy me I'm pretty sure if these rubber bands are not there I'd be dead right now look at this literally the craziest thing I've ever done before eating food it's heavy like I'm shaking right now I can this is like a workout oh my god oh hey guys it's Mike Chen I am in Toronto Canada and before I came here I asked you guys to give me suggestions about what it going eats and most of you suggested a seafood place so I went online looked it up and saw pictures of what I can only describe as a mountain of Lobster and as soon as I saw those pictures I knew I needed to be here I feel like I feel like this is the primary reason I made my trip so let's go eat a mountain of lobster as soon as we walk in we see that you guys saw that right 225 pound lobsters give or take a pound so total a 50 pound they told me pullo 51 51 pound of lobster I don't know how I'm feeling right now I feel like the calm before the storm you know I things are about to happen and it's just I feel like I'm really emotional at this point I'll talk to you guys in just a little bit we're ten minutes into the wait for the lobster I'm gonna be really honest with you guys I'm scared I don't know there's something some crazy beer you know what eye of the tiger lobster with a free and on bring it on he's scaring me because you brought this over from behind me I thought the plaster is it's just harmless egg drop soup that's all good we're not there yet we're not there yet the anticipation is building big drop soup I can do this I can't do this I got a safe space I'm sorry the appetizer is way too big look at this this is like a year's full crop for one farmer or something this is a lot of vegetables you know what let's try it I am I don't know I can't do anything just bring me the lobster the lobster is coming this gentleman said the lobster is coming to me the voice inside me just screamed Run For Your Lives I don't know why that's the that's the natural instinct we're like we're making a path for the lobster never have I seen a table cleared a path for one particular food item to arrive it's almost like the king of foods is coming here and all the subject says get out of the way true people are carrying that is it is it is it your way to run out of here and enjoy wearab scared the crap out of me [Music] you couldn't see me right that is bigger than I am you saw it one person couldn't lift this its avalanching people its avalanching the lettuce is it's falling off giant lobster Mountain if you never see Mount lobster before here it is I don't know I'm just have expecting to see like dead US presidents faces carved onto this thing I don't know if I should use the word impressed war brightened by food in my life and this bolt compresses and frightens me and makes me hungry at the same time those are really confusing feelings okay also I feel like it's leaning I don't think that's the most stable lobster mountain in the world nobody touched the table we don't want to make it Angry alright we don't want to do you rough and like I don't know get a lobster roll over everybody's face and can I just say check out the head of this last year I'll tell you guys to God on this trip if I was swimming in the ocean and this thing came at me I've run it like he might be a sloop and then I'm running I'm swinging away to shore as if Charles is chasing me this is cook like Hong Kong style so see like little bits of garlic I feel really weird trying to describe to you guys how this might taste because I feel really secured I'm trying to heat it one because it is so massive and Su is like Ginga I feel like if I take off the wrong piece it's all coming down I'm bad at Ginga I don't know what to do yeah I need to be prepared this is a sacred job I don't want to contaminate the lobster mountain there's a piece right down here but I feel like might be okay yep it's a loose piece it's okay it smells like none else like it could be a little sweetness sour I didn't know how to eat this I can't identify what this is it's all like battered and fried by oh see that as beautiful view schlosser you know what when there's good are you you're delicious I'm gonna get the heck outta you don't imitate me this is awesome it's a little spicy a little sweet I thought it's gonna be a little sweet and spicy because that's how the aroma is giant monster Lobster me how's Riggins good you know what then I go swimming in the ocean makes me just to find me a giant Lobster this is incredible meat is tender easy is legit Tom point - delicious onion in there peach let's try to find a piece I can identify and also we'll make this mountain collapsed um this okay this is a piece of the tail I think with gloves is the only way you can heat this because just the tail alone I feel like it's this big no for just handling that and you can see right here if I'm the skin pattern flakes of chilly little piece of garlic smells incredible just a tiny piece of the lobster tail it's already a huge fight oh my fridge that's probably some hot oil okay know what else can I share disregard the brending size of it it's two hours delicious that's a tiny French let me just do a piece okay I know that piece it's bad because that's stuck in there and if I remove that I feel like this thing is gonna tumble like oh my goodness is having now let's remove a piece from the top of the mountain let's come to the top here Oh on the top is all the seasoning this is just tried garlic and I'm gonna remove a piece from the very top let's climb the lobster summit it's burning hot right now let's take that for our Sonia hot oil you'll never hear this probably shed anywhere else but this is the most delicious mountain ever I just want to see what this is they have a lot of seasoning here oh there's like little fishies here like little tiny anchovies weird a little tiny shrimp here these are a little 20 fish I didn't know that so you kind of just got the ocean here as much as I love this and as much as I think I can tackle this on my own there's not a food challenge I'm not trying to eat 50 pounds of lobster even though I think that's heads up all hang on this is kind or --mess we must be scary coming at you when you're swimming in the ocean right now and we don't laugh at me I think if you still to come here let me just take this out I'll just dried stuff yeah don't look like that meat just take the food thing oh good god you can't get this whole thing that that's Lobster bring is it did you know that if you need lobster brains it makes you smarter yeah that's true why do you think zombies once rings all the time they want to become smarter really dumb right now yeah that's officer brain I guess Margot planea slimy pink really not to that okay you know what I know I said I could eat this by myself I'm kidding that's why I have a lot of friends here they're gonna share with me we're gonna tackle this announcer we're gonna climb it we're gonna conquer it and then we're gonna roll out of here because we're gonna be stopped are you guys ready all right let's take down this monster just just make sure he doesn't collapse and show us yes hey Kurt [Music] okay it's been about half an hour and we barely made attempts we're still gonna keep trying I think we could have done a lot better but we just filmed our dim sum video so we filmed up down some video ate everything then came here and try to eat this I think we did pretty good under those circumstances oh we have a good solution we have a there's a meet up right after this which I'm about to hit you so if you're at the meet up and I'm looking all dazed and confused I'm high on lobster I'm sorry we're gonna try our best and then take the rest for for the people that show up to the meetup I think that's the best we can do and we're also gonna bring the hips I'm sure we'll meet some lobster head eaters over there so there it is that is what's hidden under the mountain of lobster I think we had a valiant effort today we were a little intimidated when it before it first came now you know know how it is it's like when you go on a really crazy amusement park ride it's the anticipation that's really hurts you it's the anticipation that's the worst part of it right go lobsters self absolutely delicious area of course you guys save some space for dessert right some kind of kind of cashew congee or something oh that's pretty good but I'm really glad I had this lobster mountain experience here in Toronto I feel like grew a lot from this experience I did now I can literally say I conquered a mountain of lobster startup and of course guys as usual the information for this place is in my description box along with a link if you want to get some awesome t-shirts I love this hoodie really sucked I like to work out walk out hope that information is in the description box as well thank you all so much for watching you know until we meet again"
