friend bill if you remember him who likes old school toronto hates all the new school bike lanes anything fancy life um he said there's a great restaurant anyways i went to take a look at the oven while i waited i saw it look like a good wood-fired oven my man making the pizza was wearing a john's a bleaker shirt this man wearing a jawns of bleaker oh molly look at that shirt oh you can't set the bar any higher and he's like yeah when we developed this place i went to all the pizzerias that i heard about that you talked about and tried to base it so now my my expectations like i tend to like what you like is through the roof i mean john's bleak is a hall of fame first ballot one of my favorites i've ever had barcelona that was awesome touchy feel you know personal space right touched me like 18 times in a minute so here we go um konzo a little oily greasy in there i can smell it also really cool the guy that bricks around the oven he he basically his old high school was torn down or something he took all the bricks from his old high school which is right around the corner and built the oven that's a story that's story time i'm not into the me too [ __ ] but i just i couldn't

see what we got here kanzos [Music] you know what there's more crisp than what it would look like with that flop like you could kind of probably hear it a little bit great undercarriage distinctive this is way more flavorful than john's a bleeker and how i say that i generally like clean and simple like i don't like to necessarily be overwhelmed with what i would consider sometimes artisan pizza this tends to be more on the artisan side if you ask me you did say preferred the cauli over john's you know what before i score i'm going to give this the benefit of a cool because sometimes this is so hot out of the oven i was waiting to get the flop you got to let it firm up that's just an insider trick that's a little inside of trading in the pizza world by the way there's pizza places like what kind of i've never been to cheetos what type of maniac would go there over here i just know you're a maniac to go to cheetahs all right let's see if it firmed up still no score so i still have

when you die what's the process like the white smoke who's gonna be the plume who's next is it one pizza one month what's his name no you got like a weird obsession with him i may i may leave him here like have you seen pulp fiction it'll be like in the basement like one of those masks put him in the car and we'll take him into my garage and we'll close the doors and we'll see what happens he will [ __ ] his pants won't he yeah i'll [ __ ] my pants dude what would he do for you what do you do you just seen it it's the middle of the week and you're just lounging around watching pizza reviews maybe that's what we do we started by the yesterday morning because we thought you would be there they're from windsor you you know where winter is after you retweeted you just you're just throwing darts at the dartboard well we after you retweeted this thing we figured you would come so you guys like batman and robin you jump into the car and head to a place be like robin don't have a car we have a plan that doesn't sound like that to you guys we got the flag buddy don't worry uh it's april it's snowing so i guess that makes sense little snow flurries in toronto um around 50 years in business good story old school new school right what the guy's pointing yeah the cheese pizza slices zero to three i uh that was a cool thing they were telling us what you did in kobe that you guys just let people come in and pay what they could listen it was tough uh we were doing really really well the story behind it is people were trying to give me money because i released an article about my condition people go back and i'm like don't feel bad for me my business is booming we open seven days a week and i need a deal with the guidance and i'm not going to take the money i can't keep the money yeah so we said it was fun i still have the banner up there yeah yeah so somebody comes in one very whatever we try to help them right just like you did yeah so we got it in there but he said during covent great move the guy just basically this guy's here too i can't can't this is a fluke because i can't believe it's awesome that he got you up here and what do you mean no i don't know it's good i'm glad i'm here i mean i was like uh you guys go ahead do you think are you guys no i'm not in it i don't know what the hell's going on uh this is old school so we got the places all recommended to us and then this guy we met and he's like here you go you he does not like the new school you got to go old school so it's around 50 years listen dave the places i tell you guys they're old school but they're like they're sevens you know what i mean but you gotta go you gotta show a good account of toronto i mean in the backseat of your car i don't know what more i can [ __ ] [ __ ] starstruck no i know but you keep being like you got to do this you know your representation in toronto i am in your car the pizza maker frank was losing his eyesight so still makes the pizza here we are to try it uh one bite every one of those rules good good firm crust there there's the undercarriage very hot just came out of the oven so i want to give it a second super light this is a very very light pizza which generally bolds well for whether i like it um see what we got great dude inside we already said the whole covet thing just pay what you can which we love to see love to hear you know what's strange the other place recommended gigi's has a similar like cross taste to it which i said was like a super distant distant distant distant distant distant relative to um new haven but it's like doughy and chewy light new pretty traditional overall i'm over this [Music] it's good it's good it's thin it's light you can hammer this whole thing in a seven i i in a second i go like seven three on this i think it's a good quality local pizza spot and again i say it all the time i am busting crazy guys balls because make no doubt about it he's [ __ ] insane and i don't know what he does with his life except follow me around for pizza but he is but he is right pizza is as much about like the people making it and how long in the story 1965 so you're going close to 60 years in business

    "transcript": "[Music] all right hi peace review time uh we are body ali we are a corner of dover court and somewhere else i've never had this i got like a mini standing o from the patrons when i walked in there like people clapping it was like he's here he's here very busy um this is probably i've said a couple times uh maybe north of brooklyn but i think this was the most recommended like hey this is where you're gonna want to come it's your style you'll love it um so here we go i think it's relatively new if i've done my research like a couple years how long has this place been here a little over a year little over a year oh i'm back i told you i live around the corner this is our guy this is i i described him in nice terms as the crazy guy from the other day if you don't go to pizza gigi it's a shame he's old school that's the oldest pizza maker in the city they open at four call the guy cheese pizza 20 minutes it's ready all right that's the oldest pizza all right he's back and we have passion yeah we and we did gigi's i've had it what was it i've had it from from fairbanks to fiji nothing compares to pizza gigi they gave me the hole all right so here we go this is a big review you said this would be my john's oblique number one my number one um so right now my number one so far has been north of brooklyn i love descendants if you like uh detroit style um one night only was very good so we've had really good pizza here we go there's the undercarriage it's a little bit of a crowd a little bit of a wind i'm dealing with but we'll persevere we'll persevere let the wind die down i don't want that to affect has that crisp that you need very very good [Music] that's like eerily quiet out here people are waiting for the score it's great pizza no doubt you said be my favorite i'm going 8-3 very good but if you're keeping score at home i still have north of brooklyn at 8-4 slightly ahead but very comparable both great pizzas um and you knew it coming in so many people said it it's packed in there this is great you can't go wrong with it so uh body ali i pronounced that right body ali that is an eight three great pizza it's just great pieces nothing you can complain about it um so yeah there you go that's a review that's all i got yeah very good very good what do you guys like more north of brooklyn look at this one buddy but you got to remember the owner chased you down a thing this one you didn't get that kind of treatment yeah you made this yeah they made it you got it the same way we just ate here before you made it off the line yeah yeah yeah yeah no this is great there's nothing that dave inquiring want to know what happens to the remainder of the pizza always the crew eats it right i mean it depends where we are david with cousins if things go wrong with me and my wife i get him in the divorce turn around you got to get the church you were baptized bro yes i was what did you give gigi i gave it a seven largely based on i like the people in there yeah i told you it's old school it's old school again you gotta go you don't do topics but they're breaking through topics descendants i love uh the detroit style it's always as good as detroit size you can have this guy lost a little credibility though all right whatever but i told you go there old school you said that was better than britain no no i didn't yeah that was a new school this gold squad what's better potando and gigi's my home ballpark is gg listen gigi has what you like that thin crust all right we're going to have you gone to see frank's pizza house no because you know what we had that conversation we said it all depended how what i thought gigi when i go to frank's i know it's one eye no no he's got limited vision but he's a legalized guy you got to back up though you got to back up you got to go see him no you got tons of room you're good you're good you're good where's your crew man where's that where's that one month guy you got to whip
