have a plan that doesn't sound like that to you guys we got the flag buddy don't worry uh it's april it's snowing so i guess that makes sense little snow flurries in toronto um around 50 years in business good story old school new school right what the guy's pointing yeah the cheese pizza slices zero to three i uh that was a cool thing they were telling us what you did in kobe that you guys just let people come in and pay what they could listen it was tough uh we were doing really really well the story behind it is people were trying to give me money because i released an article about my condition people go back and i'm like don't feel bad for me my business is booming we open seven days a week and i need a deal with the guidance and i'm not going to take the money i can't keep the

light pizza which generally bolds well for whether i like it um see what we got great dude inside we already said the whole covet thing just pay what you can which we love to see love to hear you know what's strange the other place recommended gigi's has a similar like cross taste to it which i said was like a super distant distant distant distant distant relative to new haven but it's like doughy and chewy light new pretty traditional overall i'm over this [Music] it's good it's good it's thin it's light you can hammer this whole thing in a seven i i in a second i go like seven three on this i think it's a good quality local pizza spot and again i say it all the time i am busting crazy guys balls because make no doubt about it he's [ __ ] insane and i don't know what he does with his life

walked in there like people clapping it was like he's here he's here very busy um this is probably i've said a couple times uh maybe north of brooklyn but i think this was the most recommended like hey this is where you're gonna want to come it's your style you'll love it um so here we go i think it's relatively new if i've done my research like a couple years how long has this place been here a little over a year little over a year oh i'm back i told you i live around the corner this is our guy this is i i described him in nice terms as the crazy guy from the other day if you don't go to pizza gigi it's a shame he's old school that's the oldest pizza maker in the city they open at four call the guy cheese pizza 20 minutes it's ready all right that's the oldest pizza all right he's back and we have passion yeah we and we did gigi's i've had it what was it i've had it from from fairbanks to fiji nothing compares to pizza gigi they gave me the hole all right so here we go this is a big review you said this would be my john's oblique number one my number one um so right now my number one so far has been north of brooklyn i love descendants if you like uh detroit style um one night only was very good so we've had really good pizza here we go there's the undercarriage it's a little bit of a crowd a little bit of a wind i'm dealing with but we'll persevere we'll persevere let the wind die down i don't want that to affect has that crisp that you need very very good [Music] that's like eerily quiet out here people are waiting for the score it's great pizza no doubt you said be my favorite i'm going 8-3 very good but if you're keeping score at home i still have north of brooklyn at 8-4 slightly ahead but very comparable both great pizzas um and you knew it coming in so many people said it it's packed in there this is great you can't go wrong with it so uh body ali i pronounced that right body ali that is an eight three great pizza it's just great pieces nothing you can complain about it um so yeah there you go that's a review that's all i got yeah very good very good what do you guys like more north of brooklyn look at this one buddy but you got to remember the owner chased you down a thing this one you didn't get that kind of treatment yeah you made this yeah they made it you got it the same way we just ate here before you made it off the line yeah yeah yeah yeah no this is great there's nothing that dave inquiring want to know what happens to the remainder of the pizza always the crew eats it right i mean it depends where we are david with cousins if things go wrong with me and my wife i get him in the divorce turn around you got to get the church you were baptized bro yes i was what did you give gigi i gave it a seven largely based on i like the people in there yeah i told you it's old school it's old school again you gotta go you don't do topics but they're breaking through topics descendants i love uh the detroit style it's always as good as detroit size you can have this guy lost a little credibility though all right whatever but i told you go there old school you said that was better than britain no no i didn't yeah that was a new school this gold squad what's better potando and gigi's my home ballpark is gg listen gg has what you like that thin crust all right we're going to have you gone to see frank's pizza house no

there's a [ __ ] thing there no one's coming down there um all right blondies so we have blondie's pizza i i've lost track of like what areas of toronto i'm in but it's a [ __ ] cool city every area i'm like oh this is cool this is cool they got cool little shops cool restaurants cool right next to a greek place they look fantastic um so blondie's the box is a trip not eight locations they got eight locations three years interesting because it's kind of fast style it's like which isn't always my jam but it went through a conveyor belt but had a normal pizza oven so that's why i asked like what what's going on with the oven he explained sounded like contraption also um there's what it looks like because if i'm nothing not honest one of my friends down here uh is a partner in the place i was gonna do it anyways a lot of people recommended blondie's i try to keep the score on the up and up he was supposed to help me with the hotel room he [ __ ] failed and wanted to charge me 10 grand a night i'm like what who needs friends like that so i'll keep this pizza review honest how about that uh blondie's one bite everybody knows the rules it does have some flop to it i can tell which he said and you know what i think that's why he gave me big slice because it it holds it as you can see that is a conveyor belt crust right there so this is definitely i would say more on the fast style as opposed to like you're not going to italy and winning awards one bite ever knows rules blondies nine locations cool marketing drum roll let's go dave hmm good taste i think you got to do the drum roll if you're going to yell dream west baby show it dates in town see that hey give the blood clean blood fuel slice they take them no no toppings they cancel all the toppings you just gotta eat the bread vlogtio submit it they they there's more on blogto it's probably already been done all right there's a huge slice human drug roll this is good uh kind of a domino's undercarriage i bet they're open pretty late here i'm gonna go six eight i think that's a fair score for these guys for blondie this guy these guys were he wants to know who are you doing you were relaying the scope was i just getting my signals stolen what so this guy is doing are you related to this guy no i just love him this guy's given the scores now listen now he knows he's knocking i'm giving the score i got the guy in the background doing like five six it's a fair score that's a fair score i got a feeling this is like a fast casual pizza even the oven it's hard to get terrific score when you go he's still doing it he's still doing it that's it six eight blondies listen if you're going conveyor belt you can't get that much higher of a score really for that type of pizza so blondie's eight location he said wants to go to miami i'd welcome him there that is a review and this guy stole the signals over there that's what is still insane thank you [ __ ] can i get a pick with you brother can you take the can take the picture i don't do the selfies because i'm too fat frank's pizza is so clear you have it take care the guy the guy lost his vision and he's making pizza it's amazing you got to go see him
