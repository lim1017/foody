    "transcript": "hi everyone today we're going to street eats it's a food truck setup that got started because of kovid so they they wanted to do an outdoor dining experience so they got food trucks set up all around the parking lot we're gonna head on over to hillcrest mall it's the one with the most food trucks and most variety so we're gonna try two different places out for you and we're gonna review the entire thing let's go [Music] here we got el bosco's tacos we got a fish taco pork taco and chicken and then on this side we have buster's lobster sandwich with some fries everything looks tremendous it looks so pretty in the light let's give it a try where to start i start here with the fish taco [Music] let's start with the lobster roll the lobster is nice and sweet that bun is nicely toasted the buns nicely toasted and buttered up the sauce that they mix it in is like a combination of mayo i think there's like some chives and some like green onions in here it tastes really great it's really flavorful um and the lofter tastes relatively fresh it came with these like small cut fries and they honestly look very similar to like a mcdonald's fry pretty tasty so after eating a couple of these fries i can clearly taste that it's been fried with something different than just regular like canola oil i think maybe you did some like maybe peanut oil i'm not sure because they didn't disclose that it's like there's peanut allergies or anything so maybe it's just a different type of oil but it adds a really different type of flavor almost like a nuttiness to it and it tastes really great it just it's not the same as mcdonald's and obviously mcdonald's is king of fries but these are still some really great fries to eat the lobster also came with this giant pickle oh it's so juicy nice snap to the end of it nice and like a little bit of sourness to it and the pickle's really flavorful i really like that pickle it goes really well with the sandwich and the fries great combination that you find in almost like every sandwich kind of place i always get a pickle on the side and it's delicious so one thing to remember is that both of these came out of food trucks so the lobster is definitely not like right there on the spot they bought the lobster de-shelled it and then like put some put it in the sauce and mix it up it's definitely they already had it pre-made and they toasted the bun so it's nice and warm put that lobster inside and it's still a really great sandwich it's not the same like type of quality you might expect from like a restaurant but it's still very tasty and from a food truck this is actually really great next we got the tacos and tacos are amazing they smell so fresh they smell fragrant they're beautiful they have so much color to them i'm excited to try these ones out let's start with the fish taco you got some like pickled radish i think or pickled cabbage in here looks like a spicy mayo sauce and then some fried up deep fried fish hmm that sausage killer it smells really good it goes so well with the fish there's a slight tanginess to it it's not like just pure spice and mayo it almost tastes like there's a bit of like acidity from maybe some some like lime juice or lemon juice really goes well typically like you'll find places that give you the lime or lemon on the side you squeeze it on there yourself i think they've integrated it in with the sauce so that you als already get that flavor and then they control the nice balance of flavors which makes it really really great i really love the sakura next we got the pork taco so it looks like a lot of shredded like pulled pork similar to um some some black refried beans maybe some refried bees in there that pickled onion and got some of that avocado as well looks delicious the meat is nice and soft falls apart in your mouth really delicious flavors i think this is a really good it's been cooked very well i feel like the pork is a little bit on the dryer side it could be a little more flavorful maybe if they pop put like a wet sauce in there it would make it a little more juicy and that will make it even better like this one i'm biting into it the juices aren't like flowing out or anything and a lot of times when you're eating like a pork taco you bite into it those juices are just like oozing out and it gets all over your hands it's a real mess i guess that's one benefit it's not as messy but it lacks a little bit a little bit of that juiciness and flavor that you normally would get with like a pork taco last one here we got the chicken taco looks like there's a bit of cheese it looks like almost like maybe goat or feta you got some caramelized onions instead of pickled onions you got some green onions on top some refried beans this looks good [Music] oh yeah that cheese puts it on the level chicken itself is delicious caramelized onions add a lot of flavor but that cheese on top adds that extra little bit of creaminess that puts it puts it to another level that other chicken tacos might not have and i really love the combination of flavor this year they're really solid really great with the next week and we went back to the street east market and we went to six spice rack this is their south side chick burger so it comes with this ginormous fried chicken rice like smack dab in the middle and you got this bun and all over it is um some lettuce you get some like hot peppers in there they look like they might have been slightly pickled peppers as well and then like buffalo sauce and it's like just drenched with this sauce but that chicken is like it's like this big and then the buns like this so like you have all the chicken just overflowing that burger and it looks so good it's so gigantic you need two hands to get it or else look at that it's about to fall the chicken is so juicy there's some really good flavor in there i think there's a bit of cheese maybe i felt like the pull of a little bit of cheese but i really like how they did this uh fried chicken it's like a little bit crispy on the outside but still so juicy on the inside and that's what you want you want like all the juices flowing out so i don't know if you guys can see this but like it's it's really juicy the peppers are nice and hot but they also have like a sweetness to them so it's not just pure heat and then like that buffalo sauce is actually really really nice and creamy as well so the combination of everything put together is actually really really good the only thing that i'll say is that this bun is getting a little soggy it's like kind of oily too like they've already toasted the bun but i guess it's so sauced up and it's so juicy that like the bun gets a little soggy but honestly in this case i don't really mind it it still tastes really fantastic even with that like you're gonna get all the mess on your hands but it's a very delicious mess um now i'm going to try out some of these fries and they look very similar to like costco fries but and they give us i guess this is may or some type of sauce i think it's like a garlic mayo but it's a really good flavor your mind is similar to like uh the garlic maybe getting like shawarmas but these fries they're very similar to like costco fries costco fries are pretty bomb so these are pretty good as well so we just finished eating everything and let's review each individual item so the lobster roll was very delicious i say it's not exactly like restaurant quality i wish they had like obviously it's asking too much for a food truck to be doing it right when you order to like post a lobster and like do all that work so it was very delicious and for like the price of i think it was 17 bucks that's very worth it it was really good i would do it again uh the fries were also delicious i really like the way they did it with like a different type of flavor to it because of the different types of oil that they used and then the pickle goes along with it so well cuts through it it's like almost like a palate cleanser when you're eating the entire meal and it's very very great for the tacos i thought that the fish taco was definitely my favorite had a great combination of flavors and that sauce was killer it was really really great if anybody tries out this place i guarantee you won't be disappointed with that fish taco the one that i kind of felt like needed some improvement was that pulled pork one it was a little bit on the dryer side but i gotta say this place is very generous with the portion sizing so a lot of other taco places i go to they give you a small taco shell with like very little meat on the inside they kind of stack it up and they have a bigger like a much bigger uh tortilla so that you can enjoy all the flavors and you get like nice and full from it the last one was the chicken and i thought that was also really great it's just below that fish the fish was just my favorite overall this place this burger and fry combo is 14. 14. that's a really good value and i can't believe i didn't find this earlier this is actually tremendous value the flavors are absolutely great they've the execution has done very very well and if i compared it to the other two dishes we got the taco and the lobster the lobster roll this comes out on top this is my favorite i highly recommend that everyone go try this out it's very very good but you can try these off for yourself i'll link it down in the description box below um they're at these malls pretty much every single day of the week most of them some of them are only on like wednesday to sunday but like they have the times on the website you can check it out for yourself and you can try these food trucks as well i think they're really great there's nothing wrong go to a food truck compared to a restaurant they can give you some really great quality food so go try it yourself and i'll see you in the next video peace [Music] you",

    "title": "Korean BBQ at Home | BOGO Deal from Cheongdam, NEW KBBQ Restaurant | Toronto Food Takeout",
    "description": "Korean BBQ is something I dearly miss so we tried a BOGO Deal for Korean BBQ Takeout in Toronto! We got pork butt & k-marinated top blade and a wide variety of banchan (korean side dishes) as well as leafs to make a ssam (wrap). We ordered from Cheongdam Korean BBQ, a new joint that opened up fairly recently that even sell some in house dry aged meats! Cheongdam Korean BBQ: https://cheongdam.ca/",

    "videoId": "yhBMiqxFofs",
    "transcript": "welcome back welcome back to what to phil's food review wait wrong language everyone so we got a special dinner meal for you guys here uh we went to chengdu korean barbecue and we got pork butt some some pork butt and some short rib and it's a take home korean bbq so they've already grilled up the meat uh for us they gave us all of the banchan the uh the samjong and the lettuce and i don't know what this leaf is but you see it all over in korea uh to make some some and let's just dig in so i think chengdu is a new place that opened up recently and they when we went inside i could see it on the wall they have their own dry asian lockers so they have different types of meat that they're dry aging in there that's probably something special that you could get if you wanted to uh we didn't go with that option today because they have a special going on right now for takeout and that's buy one get one free so you know can't pass that up that's a lot of food for like the same price that you would normally have to pay like double for so we went with that and we're going to eat all this and review each thing for you start with the meat all right i'm going to go opposite bok choy you don't eat vegetables man stop fooling everyone stop pretending all right first we got short rib let's see how how well they cook this it's decently soft there's not a whole lot of flavor coming to it i expected there to be uh a little more like saucy almost because generally speaking when you go to like a korean barbecue place you get short ribs yeah it's like marinade and certain sauce and this is this was called the marinade short rib yeah so i was expecting a little more marinade um this has a really light taste to it and it definitely tastes like um it hasn't been like overclocked it's been cooked like this like relatively nicely visually it doesn't look the best because obviously it's already been grilled and we had to take it home and like you know after a certain amount of time it's not the best let's try some of that pork butt got a big fish nice similar to the to the beef where there's some flavor but not like very pungent um i don't think i don't think there's enough flavor with it um but obviously with korean bbq you you like eat it with a bunch of different sauces you have uh different side dishes that go along with it you make wraps with it so like there's a lot of stuff that you can do to add flavor but i just wish that the meat itself had like a really great favorite to begin with and then all these things just complement on top of that giving credit that the the meat is soft and it's not overly done or undercooked or anything it's pretty good let's get on with it what else do we have here we got some bok choy um i like that it's like nice and spicy yeah what did you get that face for is like two sours on me no there's a spice to it this is bok choy that's what i meant to face this guy hates vegetables so if you see him making any face when you're eating any of a vegetable ignore it he's like the exception to the rule where he just absolutely hates it any type of vegetable he eats he's just not gonna like so uh can't really take his word for vegetables but it has a great flavor they've mixed in some spices it's like a cold dish you know yeah like it's not like they fried it up in a pan or anything it's like a cold dish and they just mix it with a bunch of spices this is something you would chew on just to like refresh a palette kind of thing this corn looks really good it's been like seasoned with um i think some chili powder these are like packed bigger or something too there's not a fresh coin at all it's just going stale isn't it yeah the flavor is a little weird to me too it's candy yeah it's really sweet but like now let me have fresh corn there's like a burst of juice it's like there's like no juice there's no just like just eating the corn kind of like dried out i don't know if this was done on purpose or just like but i don't particularly like that it is very sweet like i thought it'd be a little more spices to it but it's a very sweet glaze yeah the the corn it's like a candies isn't it i'm gonna go for meat again but we're gonna dip it in some sauce they give us some some sauce here and it's like a mixture of salt and sesame oil so maybe this will add some acid flavor to this meat it definitely adds some fragrance sesame oil has really strong flavors to it so it adds a nice fragrance to it try some of this kimchi i'm curious how this kimchi is i'm not a fan of it like most kimchi actually um i like your kimchi's are fresher and spicier i mean the only good kimchi's ever had was in korea so yeah that's true this is not bad it's uh there's no strong sourness to it because it's been pickled and then you've got the spice coming out as well so like the spice is actually more spicy than i think most other kimchi is that you usually find in in like canada or toronto but this one's actually pretty good i actually like this one what do you think i don't find it that sour actually i've had waste our more sour kimchi than this but it is definitely a more on the spicy side compared to the average korean restaurants you find here um it's nice though it's nice and refreshing it's it's not like too spicy or too sour it's good all right so the next thing we have to do is create a sound so when you're eating korean barbecue you are served with a bunch of lettuce or this other vegetable i'm actually not sure what this is leave it in the comments section below if you know what it is let me know but grab this um you put in your meat you put in whatever side dishes you want uh and then you put some samjhan and it's gonna taste completely different it completely changes up the flavor profiles just like all that mixed together so i'm gonna put short rib um this spicy green onion salad some of these onions i think they came with a sauce i don't know what's in the sauce it's like a vinegar kind of sauce just like a vinaigrette kind of almost uh some samjong so then you got this i got my son some to eat cheers i think that almost adds like a liquor flavor do a liquid flavor to this dude not fat licorice it's probably not for you this is not for me liquidation is okay you're not a huge fan though the rest of the flavors are good the beef is nice and tender got some spice from that green onion salad and you got some of the crunch from the onions and samjong always adds a ton of flavor samsung is always so good the best if you don't know what song changes it's like um soybean paste that's right soybean paste there's two containers here one has some like spicy garlic the spicy sauce mixed with some garlic the other side just has like peppers and garlic um you can mix it all up to eat together i'm gonna do lettuce this time do with the pork i forgot last time to put it in the sesame oil dressing some of that spicy it's actually quite spicy this uh green onion salad yes it's a nice kick to it i don't know what should add some box for you know why not add some kimchi too everything all in one bite oh this might be a giant mouthful let's make a salad like to say that's what she said that's what she said [Laughter] great flavor i think this is where the beauty of korean barbecue kicks in when you combine all the flavors from the wrap the meat the the bunch on this samjong you combine all the flavors from all these different little elements and it's like a mouthful of so many different flavors that all work together and it really pops so you've never had cream barbecue before this is the this is like the way you do it and honestly some of the best barbecue right unique um flavor profile itself like nothing quite like this yeah nothing quite like a korean bbq um and it's very like communal so obviously we're here we're just like presenting you this uh this meal that we got but usually when you're doing korean barbecue you're sitting together with your friends in like like either a square table a round table and the grill's right in the middle and all of you have like raw meat just grilling it and eating it having a good time drinking some soju drinking some some beers um and it's like a really good time you're just all in like this this huddle just cooking and eating together um unfortunately we can't do that cause korea but this is a nice alternative let me try this out this wrap with pickled radish i've digested some some green onions oh let's get spicy garlic in there you're always talking not to play with your food but this is literally playing with your food hey this is proper playing with your food i'm assembling i'm assembling a nice wrap for myself nothing wrong with this there is nothing wrong with this this is the proper playing with your food when you're taught as a kid what is your fusion of uh i think that pickled radish kind of cuts through the liquid flavor a little bit to mix into the other and it doesn't it makes the licorice flavor not strong so if you don't really like legumes but you can add it with some fermented radish or whatever else that you got i think it tastes pretty good i like that oh man that's a mouthful good luck you know what they say i was trying to say about yourself there's happiness in my mouth that's for my son you're making me out of yourself we're both pretty much full and we're pretty much done the meal so let's summarize everything for you guys so all right felix first let's hear from you what did you think of everything i mean nothing really stood out to me it's a pretty mediocre korean barbecue place um uh there's one place that we usually go to and their prices are really relatively similar and uh comparing the two the meat quality is definitely way better there and just based on that with the main dish of every korean barbecue being the meat we feel that this place needs to step up the game yeah so i'll just add a little bit on to that so generally speaking i feel like the meat over there was a lot better but we're looking at the side dishes um we really didn't like this corn like the koreans watching this video please let me know is this a normal thing in korean barbecue cause i've never seen it um it's something completely new to me and neither of us liked it like whatsoever i don't know why it's here we're used to having that cheese corn for korean bbq yeah cheese corn is a definite must obviously we can't have it with takeout i don't know if what they'll do when it becomes like in in-store dining but like the rest of these um let's talk about like the rest of these side dishes so i felt like all of them were actually pretty good green onion salad i felt like was that was really good it reminded me of something i had in like la um the bok choy salad that was pretty good too yeah with that kick it was it was definitely yeah it was definitely a nice spicy kick to it um i felt like this onion these onions mixed with a sauce it could have been more sauce they didn't like give us a whole lot um generally when we went to our favorite place to go to always is um i'll link both of these in this description box below but they give you like this bowl of onions with a sauce in it and when you dip the meat in there or like you get some of that onion it soaks up it sucks up all the flavors and it adds so much it adds like it's like vinegary it's kind of sweet it adds so much to the meal when you have that um and i felt like that missing a bit of that sauce but it's hard for me to give you guys like a full assessment of the meat because obviously they cooked it ahead of time um took us maybe like 20 minutes to get back here and filming and all that stuff so like i don't want to say that it's 100 100 percent worse than a and like i don't ever want to return i would like to try it once in the store to see what the experience is like if it's different from this but so far like as a takeout dish i'm not really excited about this i was looking forward to a much better quality korean barbecue when i saw this unfortunately this didn't meet my expectations um maybe it korean bbq should just be left for in-store dining maybe that's the thing maybe once i go in person it's gonna be great but we'll find out when that happens but until then you guys can leave in the comment section below what's your favorite korean barbecue place and like the video subscribe to the channel for lots more food reviews because i'm going to give you the truth i'm not going to hold anything back you guys hear the honest honest truth out of me so until next time peace you",

    "transcript": "hi everyone another amex offer came through and it is for italy so italy is a premium italian grocery store and they have tons and tons of delicious stands that sell pasta pizza cured me cheeses everything you can think of when you think of italy they sell it there and they've come out with this package and it comes with so much food and it's only 75 bucks with this am i softer and i looked up each individual dish and when you add it all up together it's 150 bucks so we're getting it for half off this is an exciting meal at such a fantastic place uh let's head on over and get that meal [Music] the first salad we got has some arugula has lettuce has radish some macadamia nuts and uh some parmesan like slices of parmesan cheese and it looks really good smells very fragrant like they also gave us a vinaigrette so i think it was like olive oil some salt and pepper this looks so good nice and fresh you hear the crunch from the vegetables the vinaigrette's really tasty too adds like a smooth texture to it and you got some of that salt and pepper adding flavor [Music] nice crunch from that macadamia the macadamia nuts add some nice texture and flavor to it like a little bit of nuttiness it's really really nice the vinaigrette is really nice adds so much flavor and this salad is really good the next salad has some baby arugula some cherry tomatoes and some parmesan cheese parmesan slices again it has a very similar dressing i think it was also olive oil with salt and pepper let's give this one a try i love that saltiness that comes out from the cheese really tops off the entire salad really nicely and got like a healthy hearty arugula with it and cherry tomato pop flavor little cherry tomatoes really nice add some like sweetness from the tomato once you pop it it's just like so much flavor comes out if you ask me which one i prefer i honestly like this one with the cherry tomatoes i think it's a little more simple than the other one but the flavors mixed all together work really nicely like in harmony it's just like a symphony playing at the orchestra everything's like all the flavors are just popping off right at the right time and they all mix well so well together so on to the mains we got this delicious delicious pasta it has a tomato based sauce and then you got tons of seafood so you got shrimp you got uh you got some i think this is salmon you got mussels um oh you have a little bit of squid just found some squid in here too um it smells very flavorful uh you can really smell those tomatoes coming out of it first bite i really like that flavor um you get the brightness from the tomatoes i think they might use a bit of wine like sweetness from a white wine or something to like cook uh cook some of the seafood cook the pasta in or the sauce as well you get some of that a different type of sweetness not just from tomatoes but you got a little bit of that extra sweetness from i think it's a white wine but it's really nice flavor it just comes off right right at the end there like almost like an aftertaste so salmon i think there's salmon yeah try out the salmon it's so nice and soft the texture is really nice and it has good flavor like it's really nice soft piece of salmon there here's a nice piece of squid um nice and chewy soaked up all the flavor from those tomatoes flavor is really nice and really pops got some shrimp cook really well not that not like overcooked so if you're overcooked it's going to taste like rubber nice and chewy and honestly they've done a very good job with this pasta so one thing i think you can really tell when you're eating this is that they use real tomatoes in it so you have like the skin you see some seeds in there so they're not just using like some tomato paste or like buying some of that like you know that the canned pasta sauces those have like none of that in it because it's just like it's all just been processed out this one you can tell they've actually used those type of ingredients it's fresh um it's light and it's refreshing it's very tasty pasta this next one is an angon ladi it looks like it's mixed in with a pesto and it's it has some of these little bits of asparagus i think if you remember my i think like second video at richmond station also has some angle lottie let's compare the two and see which one is actually better it's really nice and cheesy but i think it says goat cheese in it and like i do like goat cheese but in this i don't think it works as well i don't know what they put in the angle lottie at richmond station gown was really bomb i honestly prefer that one over this one i think that one's way better but at the same time this is this has great flavors as well and if you like goat cheese this might be the one for you this is still a really good pasta and it's worth ordering again the pasta is cooked this the outside layer is very nice and soft i think they actually put some shaved parmesan on top too and it's been melted in there so you get a little bit of that saltiness on top and then the base of that pesto sauce is nice and like the olive oil is really fragrant and the herbs add like a really nice flavor to it accompanying the main is these fried ball and like looks like fried toast i have no idea what these are i'm gonna bite into each one and show you what's inside first one hmm what is that there's some herbs i think it's potato and it almost tastes like a hashbrown almost but like an elevated hashbrown and it has a little bit more like savory textures to it this one looks very similar so i'm assuming it's the same but we'll bite into it and find out yup exactly the same really delicious though i really like the flavors coming out of there it's nice and soft but the outside is really really crunchy this one honestly looks like a meatball a fried meatball it looks very interesting what is that look at this it's like tomatoes inside like tomato based flavors inside the tomato sauce and i think this is what i scooped up from the insides it's almost like i think it's almost i think it might be rice inside there either rice or like shavings of potato i can't really tell which one it is or maybe it's a form of pasta but something within that realm stuffed inside with herbs a tomato sauce and then like they fried it inside this ball i have no idea how they did it but hey it's really delicious lastly we got this square and to me it automatically looks like french toast but i doubt it's french toast um let's let's find out um it's like a it has some like peas in there um and i think it's potato like now that i'm like i'm looking at this it has to be potato right it has to be it it tastes like there's strands of potato um it's been seasoned maybe there's some cheese in there as well and then they put some peas look at that these are all like really good i like how the crust is so nice and crunchy really nice crunch on the outside and the inside's nice and soft and has it's packed with flavors this is really surprising to me and so far i i don't know man this this is like the one thing that's actually like got shock on my face like i look shocked i feel like on camera we have this giant pork chop um there's a lemon there some sea salt looks like some coarse salt but it's already it's already been salted it looks like there's pepper on it too but this thing's massive it's like the size of my hand if you can see that it's the size of my hand you know what for this one i'm just gonna use my hands so there's no crunch on the outside slightly juicy on the inside it could be more juicy though might be a little more cooked but like that's hard to do with a pork chop especially when you're frying it but there's some really nice flavors coming out you really taste that pork the salt and pepper obviously adds that flavor to it the juices are flowing out of that pork chop are really flavorful it's packed with flavor i think like this is like a giant schnitzel with the bone still in tastes great it's nice accompaniment to the pastas and you have some meat with it on the side for dessert we have this delicious tiramisu it looks great it smells amazing you get all that like coffee the coffee smell coming out of it and it looks super creamy oh you get like a whiff of that coffee it reminds me of like the fragrance of like a coffee crisp or nicely fresh food coffee in the morning that's so good it's so so creamy it's rich it's sweet so the base of this is like those ladyfingers and it's nice and soft um it's not like hard and stale like you might find with like some type of breads like that and then you got such a creamy filling inside and the topping of all that uh coffee coffee flavor powder on top it is really good i really like this tiramisu and i really think you should try it for yourself overall what did i think of the entire meal well first off italy is such a cool like cool spot because you can have so you can get so many different things and if you're looking for italian food or an italian market to like get your groceries this is like the place to go they have just about anything you want to find and you'll find things here that you will not find in any other supermarket but let's go on to the food the salads were really great i like the sauces that they gave us and the out of the the parmesan on top of both of those salads with the arugula all the flavors mixed in together were very like they mixed in very well then we got the pastas both of the pastas were pretty good although i would say that they aren't the best pastas i've had so if you want a bigger a better angladi you go to richmond station i think if you want another seafood pasta taroni is a great spot where you can get one that i would say is like better quality then you got the pork chop which was nice and flavorful all although i think it could have been a little more juicy um it was a little on the drier side it did have that flavor i would say it did have flavor but i feel like it could have been juicier those like fried rice balls those were actually really good they surprised me a lot i haven't had many opportunities to actually eat that so this being one of those times i felt like that was really really great and like people should really come here and try it out for themselves maybe i'm wrong and there's some place doing it really well and like much better but i don't know any so if you know leave it in the comments down below that tiramisu was also fantastic i would eat that shiramisu any day it rivals some of the best tiramisus in toronto i would say there's not a lot of places that do it really well and this is actually pretty good for one that you can get out of a grocery store it's like pre-packaged it's really great flavors so overall i would say i would 100 recommend people try this out um italy is a fantastic place to go and visit just to do your shopping and also to get a quick bite so the meal we got since it was like only 75 bucks instead of the 150 like 100 that's the deal of a lifetime but if you have to pay the full 150 um it is a ton of food we didn't finish it you're gonna have for leftovers so i would say yeah i will get some of these items but not as much as they actually gave us but overall highly recommend people check it out eelies all over the world they have places in new york and london um they're everywhere so they're obviously doing a great job at what at like giving their product offering i hope you guys enjoyed the video leave a comment down below of what you like the most leave a like on the video and don't forget to subscribe for lots more food to come peace [Music] you",

    "title": "Extremely Flaky Crispy Chinese Burger @ Famous Chinese Street Food Joint | Bingz 西少爷肉夹馍",
    "description": "We went to Bingz Toronto (西少爷肉夹馍), a famous Chinese street food joint known for their crispy burgers and spicy fries! They transformed tradition Chinese flavors and dishes into delicious fast food menu items. They've got over 60 locations all over the world and have generated long cues because of their delicious recipes. When we went, we waited around 45 min to get all our food and it was delicious.",

    "videoId": "WOqy_Sd5VnE",
    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to the channel today we're going to bing's it's a very popular fast food joint from beijing it just landed here in toronto uh we're going there right now we're gonna pick up a few items from their menu and share it all with you and see if you should go there yourself to try it out let's go so in front of me we got a whole selection from bing's this place is like one of the top most popular uh fast food joints in beijing it was started by two guys that used to work in it for like baidu and tencent and they wanted to create something give traditional chinese flavors and their main item is this burger and it has this like really crispy um crispy and flaky bread on the outside with a ton of filling on the inside and that's like their signature item at the at the fast food joint so when we went there's different combos to choose from we caught two different combos and it comes with all of these things so you got pop you got we got black pepper black pepper beef with mushroom their signature burger with pork butt and here we got a wonton soup we got some fries with a mixture of different chinese spices these are a shake shake fries so they give you the fries in a bag with all spices in a little cup and you just toss it into the bag you shake them all up and it creates this delicious uh delicious bowl of fries so lastly we got this noodle with sliced cucumbers and tofu it comes with this spicy sauce so it's like a chili oil based and everything here looks delicious let's try it out let's review it so we'll start with the burgers first so we'll go with their absolute best one i guess their signature their signature pork butt oh once you once you pick this up you can tell that the the breading on the outside super flaky and it looks it's really crunchy too like you see that that nice coloring on the outside that it's been nicely baked it's so flaky the pork has a really nice flavor it's nice and tender and it's really light actually it's not very heavy it's not like super oily and like substantial i can almost imagine myself eating this as a snack the bread on the outside is so nice and crispy it's flaky it's delicious really has some great great flavor all right so next we got the black pepper beef i'm actually really excited for this it looks like it's going to be really flavorful looks like it's been nicely seasoned outside still looks amazing so flaky as hell i feel like crunch oh my god i've done such a good job keeping it nice and flaky and nicely cooked nice like toasted outside and right as you bite into it you immediately pick up that black pepper flavor it's nice and strong um there's a deep like rich very savory flavor to it the beef is nice and like it's not chewy it's very nice and soft i got some of that mushroom in there too i have a little bit of different texture and the flavor gets soaked up by those mushrooms and as you're biting the flavor just releases and it's such a nice flavorful black pepper sauce to this out of the two sandwiches or two burgers i actually really like this one this one is my favorite over the signature the signature is like it's really nicely done but it doesn't have as strong of a flavor and i was looking for something i like a little bit stronger flavors so the black pepper actually worked well with my palette nice refreshing coke one thing i gotta say is that the outside is when you're holding it with your hands it gets kind of oily but when you're eating it you don't actually feel it it's just really nice and toasted up and as a full meal you can eat this and it wouldn't feel too too much oil or too much it wouldn't feel too heavy or too hefty it's a really nice meal and it's nice and light with some really good flavors so now you can't go with the burger without having the fries so i'm gonna try some of these fries out mmm the seasoning is so nice it's like a sichuan spicy like dry spice kind of flavors and there's a real kick to it so if you're like not that great with spicy like this might be a little too spicy for you like i can feel it it's tingling my tongue but the fight the flavors and the spices along with like the chilies adds so much flavor and it's like a really nice flavor this honestly reminds me of like if i go into a sichuan place and i got like a hot pot like that kind of spice it's really nice flavors and like it's not just heat there's a sweetness to the flavor there's like maybe a bit of cumin coming out of there as well and i love those flavors these fries taste awesome so the fries themselves here they remind me similar to like a costco fry so it's nice and like crunchy on the outside but also nice and chewy on the inside it's nice and warming really nice flavor textures are great fries are cooked nicely overall really really great so now let's move on to the wonton this is just like it looks so nice and refreshing like a wonton soup it's got some seaweed in there some uh some sliced egg and there's this like red bean to it i don't know exactly what this is but i know it's very popular in some chinese soups and other dishes so now i'll taste the soup first [Music] has a nice refreshing flavor to it it's so nice it's really light in flavor but you get that like the saltiness of the seaweed and then you can just like pick some of it up as well to get that extra texture you got some of that egg mmm it's like nice and stringy get that fragrance from the egg now the main part the actual wontons [Music] got some meat in there yeah it might be like pork wontons and there's like a bit of herbs um i think some like green onion inside these tastes really really good and the soup complements the wonton perfectly like the flavors just melt together so well it's so nice and refreshing it's like really nice like tiny bite size wonton so you can honestly eat so many of these in one sitting especially with this soup like it's not gonna be super like heavy on you everything here is like nice and light which i really really like sometimes when you go for like fast food it gets really heavy just like sits right down in your stomach and then you feel like lethargic for the rest of the day this i feel like you can eat an entire meal and you're gonna still feel upbeat you can still have a lot of energy so lastly we got the liangpi noodles here and with the cucumber the nice uh the nice chili oil it's like a cold dish though to let you guys know it's not like supposedly supposed to be eaten hot it's a cold noodle so let's see what this flavor is like mmm nice and chewy it's nice and stringy and you get like that chili oil flavor which i really like i really love adding chili oil to my food so this is like the right type of flavor for me there's also a nice like almost like a plum sauce that comes with this so you have both of them together that plum sauce actually has a ton of flavor it's really really good like it adds a type of fragrance to it that just chili oil alone doesn't have and then you also get the spiciness of the chili oil i think the flavor combination here is really great the noodles though are not my favorite type of noodles they are quite nice but they're a little more stringy and maybe a little gelatin-y i don't know how to describe it but it's like a little chewier than most other noodles and not as like these don't taste like your traditional hand-pulled noodles it tastes slightly different but like overall the flavor is really great i feel like the texture just a little a little bit not up my alleyway but i can see a lot of people liking this still and then you have the tofu here that soaks up all of those flavors together they're really nice like add some like chewiness to the entire meal overall this noodle is really fantastic i love how the refreshingness of the cucumbers like you have some that spicy and you brighten some cucumbers and that juice just like comes out and it's like a really refreshing pop of flavor that mixes together really well the entire dish we're gonna finish off this food we just took little bites of everything here and honestly everything here i think is really fantastic this is almost like restaurant quality food that you could find at some other places but this is made into like a fast food joint so right now it's brand new in toronto it's super popular so the line was a little bit long i think we waited maybe like 45 minutes to get all our food but the flavors are really popping and you don't actually find this at many other places like these flavors even though i eat chinese food a lot i haven't had these things in a long long time i can't even remember the last time i had this type of like uh flaky bready like flaky bread burger i think for a fast food joint this is giving you some like really great flavors that's even like normal restaurant quality so this is definitely worth trying and you get some like traditional chinese um chinese dishes that you can try and i hope that you like them too so go and check them out they're at first markham place these are all fantastic i can see why this chain is so popular they have like chains all around beijing they have tons in china and they just came here so you might as well go try it as well i hope when you go try it you enjoy the food and i hope you enjoyed this video if you did leave a like leave me a comment if you do try it what did you find how did you find it and subscribe to the channel for lots more food videos to come and i'll see you next time peace we just finished all the food and oh my god we are so full we didn't even finish the fries i think if i were to get an actual combo by myself it'd be like somewhat difficult to finish it's quite a bit of food you",

    "title": "Authentic Chinese Hand Pulled Noodles & Fried Dumplings | Toronto Street Food | Big Beef Bowl 牛大碗",
    "description": "We visited Big Beef Bowl 牛大碗, an authentic chinese hand pulled noodles, fried dumplings (sangji bao) and chili oil spicy beef and tripe. This restaurant is right outside Toronto in Markham and served up some of the best bowl of noodles in the entire Greater Toronto Area. The soup is filled with beef flavor, the braised beef is tender and falls apart as you bite it and the noodles are cooked perfectly.",
    "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n9jCBhuNtyc/hqdefault.jpg",
    "videoId": "n9jCBhuNtyc",
    "transcript": "so welcome back to the channel uh today we're going we went to the big beef bowl so this is one of my go-to spots for hand pulled noodles like chinese style so i got the braised beef with flat uh flat regular noodles so when you go to this place you have the option to choose whatever type of noodle style you like whether it be flat or round and then you can also choose a thickness so it can be really thin normal which is like what you would typically find at a restaurant or you can have it really thick if that's the style that you like but it lets you change that up so that you have different textures when you're eating and not just like every time you go there's the same noodle you get a different one every time if you want to if you have a go-to um you can do that too and just like hey you can kind of customize it to the way you like they have other flavors as well in terms of soup base and sort of toppings so you can explore the menu i'll link it down description below um and you can go check that out so first thing we're gonna try right now is that noodle um it looks really good like when you look at some of the pieces of the beef brisket falls apart no problem it's so tender so soft and carries so much flavor it's like a very savory um it almost tastes like uh five spice you know star in these you taste some of that in it has some of these radishes a nice light refreshing vegetable so first sip of that soup so much of that beef flavor i'm pretty confident it's a beef broth and it carries so much flavor in it i love drinking this soup but another thing you can do if you like make it spicier so they always give you chili oil we got that here i'll maybe add some later after i eat it a little bit i'll tell you how that tastes with it mixed in whenever you go to a noodles place like i feel like the most important things that you always gotta look for is a really good broth so this one's super tasty super flavorful filled with spices and herbs like there's a slight little bit of spice to this one um it's not like neutral so if you're one of those people that think pepper spicy this you might feel like this is spicy too but to me this is like this is like somebody just like crazy that's how soft the spice is to me but the flavors are delicious it's filled with that like the the beef flavor after being like like brewed for so long and boiled for so long so this is what regular flat noodles look like let's give it the first bite nice and chewy you can tell that it's actually really harmful and not done by a machine here you got like a little thicker so you got a little thinner so you can see that it's made freshly every single day at the restaurant they boil it in hot water and comes out nice and tender or like al dente i guess if you want to use an italian term but it comes out nicely ready to eat and it has such a nice um has a such nice texture to it and because they made it so nicely it goes really well with the soup so that flavor from the soup transfers onto the noodles and it's so delicious this is one of my favorite like beef brisket noodle places like hand pulled noodles i don't think this is necessarily like a taiwanese style noodle like you know there's a taiwanese beef brisket soup this is a different style i think it's more of a chinese like a mainland china style but this is really really great and i love the flavors coming out of this the beef brisket is so nice and tender it's like it falls right apart like look at that you stretch it a little bit comes right off if you think you're missing some of that vegetable it comes with some bok choy some delicious bok choy but whenever you go to one of these restaurants they always give you a bottle of chili oil or like this little container of chili oil at the restaurant they'll have it on the side on every single table so you can always have access to it and we're just gonna pop and put in some of that chili oil for me usually i just like picking out all the chilis out of it and spreading it around um i don't necessarily like adding the the oil but that's how they like get the aromas and the flavors out of the chili the chili peppers when's so powerful today just mix it up with all of that nice chili oil this is gonna have a completely different profile to it now so now when you're eating it you have that same strong beef flavor but the chili oil adds another layer of just that kikka flavor some heat so that after you take that sip of soup that heat lingers on your mouth it's very delicious flavor like because it's been fried up in that chill in that oil the flavors have just opened right up like all of those dried chilies or those like um chili seeds they've all just been opened up all the flavors have popped out and you get that like kick of flavor once you eat a bite with any of that chili oil in it also got some side dishes with this noodle so one of my favorites right here is this is slices of braised beef and tripe so they've all been like braised they've all been cooked really nicely and they become very tender and what they did is they mix it in with a ton a ton of chili oil so if you look like the bottom of this has so much like oil and chilies it looks really spicy they've been like soaking in this for a while now the flavors really integrated into there and i'm going to take a bite and i'll let you know if it's too spicy or if it's not so here first let's grab like a slice of beef such good flavors you may be so good i love the flavors coming out of this it's nice and spicy like and don't get me wrong it's not really hot if you can take like a mild hot sauce this is kind of how spicy it is and the the beautiful thing about this is like there is that spice but there's also tons and tons of flavor so you get like almost like a nuttiness out of it you get that nice flavor of beef coming through as well is not overpowering the beef at all it just complements it really really well and next we got the tripe i think tripe's the inner layer of the stomach and it's been cooked really nicely let's take a bite look at here it's like nice and chewy there's almost like a gelatin like um texture towards it and like if you've never had it this might be a little odd for you but it honestly to me tastes really really good you can find it in faux and like some other some other dishes as well but tripe has really nice texture to it it captures in a lot of that flavor and it has its own like juice profile so the flavors pop once you bite into it that gelatin releases some of that flavor and you get that mixed in again with that flavor of the chili oil that just adds like it really complements it well this generally comes as a cold dish on the side so whatever you're eating whether it be rice noodles whatever it might be this can go really nicely right on the side every time every couple bites of that noodle grab a grab a slice of beef some nice chili oil beef and like it's a delicious compliment to any type of meal any main that you have this is a tremendous compliment so good i also got this thing called sanjin bao so it's like a fried uh fried pork dumpling or fried pork bao if you want to call it that so let's get a fresh one here so it's nicely fried up on the bottom and because it's sealed up like this it's like almost steaming the meat inside so it releases all the juices out of the i think it's beef or pork that's inside of here so one thing before we start eating this uh you might have see i already started eating one but one of the things that you have to remember when you're eating something like this is be careful of not just grabbing it and taking a giant bite out of it really quickly it's filled with like really hot juices from the meat so that so if you actually take a giant bite you're gonna burn the hell out of your mouth and it's happened to me it's happened to some friends um and what's worse than that is sometimes you bite into it and a whole pop on the other side and splash all your friends so be careful don't do that one way to eat it show you now what a lot of people like to do actually is take a bite out of it like really tiny bite from the edge and then you can pour out all of that juice and then so that it doesn't splash around right you're gonna drink this it's like a soup oh really flavorful so good oh all the flavors from that meat is just all concentrated into that juice it's so delicious but now you have a very whoops now you have a nice a nice dumpling that won't splatter and won't burn the hell out of you either way just be careful when eating these things the meat inside retains so much juice because it's just captured all into this wrapping the bottom is nice and like a little bit crispy the tub has some like sesame seeds on it honestly the wrapping for this bow or dumpling it made very nicely it's like nice and thin on the top side and then the fried side's a little thicker obviously because you're trying to fry it up so it gets a little more cooked but they've made it into a perfect ratio where the bottom is nice and crispy but the insides are still nice and chewy while the meat is just all the flavors captured up and it's all captured right into this little package of joy and you get to bite into it and experience all of the flavors that come out of it it's just this is a treat if you have not got sanji about i don't know what the hell you've been doing go get yourself some try it because this is um overall what i think of this place you saw that i enjoyed every single item from this meal and this is honestly one of my go-to spots i come here all the time i bring friends and family i come here alone even on my days off and when i'm when i just really feel like some takeout just like today i came out here because i really enjoyed this meal i want to share it all with you um i'll leave everything in the description box below so you can check

    "transcript": "once you've had this why even go back to regular donuts today we got a feast from cup cow thai it's a thai restaurant that's located oddly enough close to a gas station it's like right in the same plaza as the gas station it's the first place like this i've ever seen but they have some fantastic food i'm gonna share it with you today today we're having a picnic in the park and you guys are joining us so right now i guess i have a promotion if you spend more than like 45 dollars then you get free spring rolls so we got these spring rolls to try i think they're purely vegetarian so carrots onions maybe some cabbage let's see how it is with some plum sauce that batter is like super crunchy and the plum sauce is delicious it's nice and sweet and maybe like i don't think there's any spice to it it's just a really nice sweetness to add it to the crispiness of this and it kind of cuts through the fattiness of the fried like fried layer but this crispy as hell the insides are nice and soft yeah it's just a really standard spring roll but really delicious i love spring rolls so i could eat these all day so story time we're originally supposed to go to a filipino food because hannah sung if you're still watching my videos i try going to a filipino place this time and we're trying to get a platter and told us it was gonna be another hour wait and we're just like we gotta do it next time so the next video is gonna be filipino if you guys are excited for that leave a comment below tell me how much you love filipino food and look out for that video coming soon next we have something called chicken toast it's kind of a funny name i don't see why it's called chicken toast actually i think i do know why it's called chicken toast there's chicken inside a piece of toast and it's kind of fried up um you see like i think some type of vegetable leaf on top and like maybe a pepper small piece of pepper or tomato honestly the ones i had no description of what's inside this chicken toast but let's just take a bite and we'll see for ourselves it also came with a sauce on the side it has has some peppers onions and cucumbers in it [Music] very very interesting it's almost like um if you have like a lightly fried out french toast but you put a bit of chicken in it and then you have the sauce that's a little bit vinegary i see everyone ordering this when i search it up online but to me this is kind of just okay if you really like french toast maybe you'll you'll love this a lot but it's like a savory french toast with chicken like i could eat this again i'm not saying like i wouldn't but it's not something that i think i'd be craving or like wanting to go back to them to eat this again and again but there's a very popular dish so a lot of you guys might like it okay next is one of my favorites from this place i love this thing it's called a shrimp donut and i know that sounds kind of weird but it's literally just like a ton of dice up shrimp maybe with a couple like green onions or something and just fried up into a donut shape it's the most amazing thing you can ever see it's like a honey sauce on the side it's a mix of honey and like maybe some vinegar let's get tons of that on this it's like glistening it's glistening it looks so good guys this thing is so good the crunchy batter on the outside it's so nice and crisp it has a nice crunch but once you get into the inside it's really thin laying on the outside that's actually crispy but once you get into the inside layer it's soft the shrimp flavor really comes out and it's a soft texture because they've chopped it up so finely and that sauce it's really sweet like honey it doesn't overpower it like really just brings out the flavor of the shrimp and i love this this is like one of the best appetizers i think you can get this entire place it's so good you guys would never regret getting this honestly once you've had this why even go back to regular donuts all i want now are shrimp donuts forever for the rest of my life i'll eat this for breakfast ah guys i'm super uncomfortable i hate sitting cross-legged this is difficult for me so bear myth bear with me if i look like i'm struggling if i look like i'm in an awkward position i'm like hunched over and stuff it's because i hate sitting down like this but you know it's a nice day having a picnic's a fun time there's a very interesting name it's called pacquiao i don't actually know what that means but it's a noodle dish with that we got shrimp with has some red and green bell peppers it's got some like string beans some string beans and there's a super super long thing called baby peppercorn i've never seen this actually it looks kind of funny i don't know if it has a particular taste actually let's take a bite oh kind of spicy pretty spicy damn i guess it is a peppercorn so what did i expect to happen oh it's a little spicy it's not that bad though it's actually not even worse than a regular peppercorn oh the sun's out it's so nice and beautiful let's say let's take a nice bite of this you see this is uh what rice noodles flat rice noodles it's cooked with some egg so it's really fragrant the egg like the fragrance from the egg really comes out the noodle and you actually taste that pepper that peppercorn you can taste that spice coming out from it and i guess that's where most of the spices actually coming from oh the coke up that trip really nicely really nicely nicely cooked i think the sauce for this noodle is like a mixture of maybe like some hoisin or soy sauce it's a very savory texture or a very savory flavor to it mixed in with a lot of peppercorn flavor it's really delicious but it's a it's a lighter sauce actually i can't get over the fragrance of the egg add so much to this without egg this noodle will be completely different but they've added it in here and it's just it's really good i really like this noodle it kind of reminds me of a chinese noodle like it's a stir-fried rice noodle flat rice noodle like this it's very popular very common like chinese dish but similar but spicier because of that peppercorn and slightly different taste because obviously like thai like they use different they use different ingredients and different spices than chinese people do okay so next here we got some green curry with chicken so hopefully you guys can see this oh my back it was like getting tight from sitting like this my hair no my hair so this green curry is it looks super creamy i don't think it's very spicy though let's take a bite of this let me take a sip of the curry to get that full flavor oh so so nice and creamy i think they add like coconut milk into it that just oh so so nice it's a little bit of a little bit of spice very little and you can taste the basil coming out the curry powder just all those flavors mixed together it's so savory but what goes really well with that is rice plain rice mix that all together and we're gonna have a full bite right now of the chicken chicken green curry and rice oh the green curry is so good the flavor from that so that that coconut milk is just so bomb like that the flavors the balance of flavors is so on point i don't think you get much better than this like this is such a fantastic green curry green curries are super popular you can find them at almost like every thai place but to get one as exceptional as this you got to come to kakaotai the eggplants also cooked perfectly nice and soft oh hold on hold on i gotta change positions this is too much for my legs oh okay now i probably look even more awkward but try some of that bamboo shoot usually bamboo shoots are really like hard and they have a burst of flavor this one's actually soaked up all the flavor from the green curry it's been boiled down so it's nice and soft too so the texture is actually really nice you don't get like because i feel like it would be kind of weird if it was really tart still you have like a crunchy one with your rice so now it's nice and soft soaked up all the flavor beautiful so this is one of our go-to thai places honestly i don't think i go to any other thai place in scarborough richmond hill markham none of those places do i go to a thai place except for this this is the best thai food in all of scarborough you guys should check this out get the get the green curry get the shrimp donut for sure like you guys will not be disappointed at all these they make it so good you guys will love it now that you've heard my review i'm gonna go and finish the rest of this food because there's still a lot here i'm gonna go finish it you guys have a nice day i'll see you guys next time like the video sub to the channel and until the next adventure peace",

    "description": "We visited J & J Kapuso Filipino Restaurant where we ordered their Kapuso Platter and Halo Halo! The platter came with so many different meats, including lumpia, chicharon, embotido, roast beef, chicken skewers and crab sushi. There were some good items and other that weren't so good. The Halo Halo is a delicious dessert and you can never go wrong with that.",

    "transcript": "today we got filipino food finally so hannah song if you're still watching uh we got filipino food and i'm gonna share with all you guys today we got this from j j capuso filipino restaurant this is their capuso platter number two and oh my god this thing's huge i have no idea how we're gonna finish all this food but let's try each one of these things i'll review each item let you know what it is tell you the flavors and you can decide for yourself if you want to go over there and try it as well so i thought i'd take the time now to tell you guys the story of i guess how i got scammed so pretty much before we even went to this restaurant we saw they had really great reviews or like really high rating on yelp so we looked at what kind of platters they had and on the website it says 34.99 on different instagram posts from my june and july it also said 34.99 and then the hollow hollow is 6.99 it says that even at the store and when we price this out the total is actually only like 47 bucks but i remember very clearly that i gave her 60 i got 10 back that pretty much means that they added a dollar to each of the items and i just overpaid because well i guess i didn't pay attention at the time and that's that's on me and i decided to look into it uh and then i see some yelp and google reviews saying that same thing that they got overcharged as well and like yeah i understand it's like it's only two bucks it's not a really big deal i'm not it's not gonna kill me but it's the principle um you can't don't just overcharge people like that and i wanna let you guys know the real truth about it since it happened to me i don't want it happening to you so if you are going to try this place out just pay attention to what kind of prices they're punching into the cashier all right back to the video first thing let's try the lumpia so lumpia is this spring roll looking and they have pork and chicken let's just bite into it see which one this one is which is really good i really like the stuffing i think this one's chicken contest chicken to me the one thing that's not as great is that it's not very crunchy it's kind of soft like they made this a while ago maybe and it kind of got soft on the way home i don't know what these sauces are for or which item they're for so we're going to try a random one i don't know if that one's for olympia tastes pretty good it's like a like a vinegary but yeah the lumpia by itself the inside tastes fantastic it's just the outside i wish it was actually crunchy and here's another one hopefully this one's pork then if the onion wash it never mind i think this might be a mixture of pork and chicken because it's exactly the same stuffing there's this red sauce here and i think this is for the lumpia oh this kind of reminds me of the sauce you get when you order like chicken balls is it chicken balls or shrimp balls at like chinese restaurants and they give you this like red sauce kind of reminds me of that super sweet really sweet but it does go well with this next there's something here that looks really interesting to me and this is like it looks like a torch sushi they listed as crab sushi i have no idea what it's going to taste like but it looks pretty good um let's try it i don't really like this that much honestly it's a lot of mayo it's like extremely creamy it doesn't have like a crab flavor i'm just getting like a lot of creaminess and rice and that's not great yeah i'm not really liking that much it's just a lot of creaminess with rice it looks good but tastes a little bit different unfortunately next you can see around the entire platter you can see these little fried skin it's chicken chicharron it looks so crispy oh my god so crunchy but it's really really good chicken skin it's already so delicious so much flavor you just fry it up give it that crunchy crunchy texture i could eat chicken skin as a snack i think people eat chicken skin regularly as a snack and it's really delicious you really like it this is this is really good i can see the chicharron being super addictive once you have one you kind of want to go back it's like eating a bag of chips you just get that crunch the saltiness the flavor a little bit of the flavor of the chicken you just keep eating them you can just like sit there watch a movie have chicharron as their snack next right in the middle here is a roast beef it looks well cooked and there's a nice gravy on top hopefully it tastes great just like it looks good ingredients from this but i do think you really need that gravy or it's a little bit dry actually the gravy is kind of where a lot some of that flavor comes through i think this roast beef is just okay kind of dry and if all you need is gravy that's like a dry turkey and you just put gravy on it no not not my favorite so on each side here you got different dishes from their hot place so they have a whole like wide array of food that you can pick from we kind of ordered it on like through the telephone and didn't ask us to pick one so they kind of picked it for us which is fine it's not like i knew what to what to pick but we got like a chicken here and beef i'm licking this chicken a little bit more so i'm gonna start with that the chicken looks like it's in a very oily sauce though i gotta say it looks like it's drenched in oil at the moment the chicken does have really good flavor and cooked well nice and tender there's like a creaminess to the sauce like they added maybe like coconut milk or something to it kind of reminds me of like a very light hurry almost the flavor of it the vegetables are also it's like almost like been boiled down so that they're really soft i love that about carrots you put them into like a stew or some type of dish like that it gets really nice and soft soaks up all the flavors of whatever you're boiling it with and that's honestly some of my like favorite vegetables is carrots being being braised with some kind of meat and on this corner we got what looks like beef cubes with some peppers there's like actual like hot peppers in there too um green pepper a bit of onion it's like a barbecued beef barbecued beef cubes it's a little spicy there's a slight kick to it you take a smokiness from the grill at the same time it is a little bit dry um they kind of cook this really like all the way through that's not really how i like my beef maybe better with some sauce this wet sauce it makes a little bit better but at the end of the day the beef is kind of chewy it's a little bit dry um the flavors on the outside are actually quite nice but just a bit dry so also on the platter is this meatloaf no clue what's inside the meatloaf looks like a bit of peppers maybe onions obviously meat and it looks like it's been like roasted or probably been like baked that's what gives it that little crust on the outside i think it might be crispy let's see not crispy at all it's just like that colored outside when you have like the roll inside the oven but the meat's nice and soft it's tender has really nice flavors pretty good meatloaf a lot of places they kind of overcook it and get really dry just actually keep some of that moistness i think because they added like the peppers and that it like releases some water that keeps it juicy last thing here is this grilled chicken skewer and it looks so good it's sauce slathered all over it you've got the grill marks right on top of the chicken this looks so good [Music] very nicely cooked dutch sauce is when it was like almost like a sweet barbecue sauce this sauce i think you could put on any type of meat it would taste really really good i think this chicken is probably the highlight of the entire meal i have so much special flavor sweetness the barbecue like you get the flavor of like the coal from the barbecue it's a little funny so it also came with korean seaweed i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do with this seaweed like if i'm supposed to wrap something in it maybe it's for the crab sushi i'm honestly not sure i feel like that's the only one that kind of makes sense yeah i'm not a fan of that crab sushi so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna try that i'll probably eat this as a snack afterwards so for dessert we ordered halo halo probably the most famous filipino dessert it looks so good there's so many different toppings inside of it it's filled with taro like coconut milk i think maybe some condensed milk and so many toppings there's so many different jellies in the bottom of this it looks really good i'm going to try and eat some of it it's gonna be kind of difficult to get everything but let's try and one of the jelly just got stuck in the straw didn't get anything it's really sweet creamy and sweet because of that like i think coconut milk and you get like only a hint of that tart i thought it would be a lot more taro in it it tastes really good though so we got this extra long spoon that's twisted not facing the right way this spoon's like crooked it's got a cooking spoon to try and scoop out some of those jellies i thought red jelly reminds me of jelly that you're getting bubble tea really tasty nice and chewy oh a green one now maybe this was like mint flavor you can't really tell jelly just crunches the jelly what's that ball just ate it'll fall and it's like not really hard but like more like meaty to it i guess compared to the jellies the other jellies well try some of the jellies i think hello hollow is a definite win it's really good dessert so you heard my thoughts on all the food here it's kind of like half and half there's some things that i really like and then some things that i'm like eh i could i could honestly do without i think my favorite is probably this chicken the chicken skin and the chicken kebab probably those the three chicken things are probably my favorite lupia is actually one of my favorites as well that one loopy is really good the other stuff i can kind of live without they weren't that great and i wouldn't i don't think i'm not really like craving it hollow hollows really great dessert i would definitely get this again it's really really yummy one thing i gotta say before we end this video is that i think they might have over charged this for this i hope it's an honest mistake but yeah they charge us like an extra like extra buck or two for each of like for the platter and for the hollow hollow different from their menu price i didn't really notice it at the time and then afterwards i kind of looked back and i'm like wait wasn't supposed to be that expensive but whatever maybe it's a one-time thing i don't know still that kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth after that so i guess the main question is will i be returning and it's a probably no i probably won't return because it's actually really far away from where i live like a solid like 30 minutes away it's not close to like anything it's like in the middle of scarborough i probably won't be returning because i don't think i don't think the food is that good that i want to go back you know it's pretty good if you're around the area or if you just really want to try some filipino food you can check it out i'll link everything in the description box below like the video sub to the channel and i'll see you guys next time peace

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to the channel today i got a super exciting meal for you guys so we got an amex offer and they're giving us uh two full sets from toca a restaurant within the risk carlton for 85 and after looking at the prices on toka's actual menu this is an absolute steal so i'll put the prices up on the screen and you guys can look for yourself and see what the savings are like so we're going over to the risk carlton now to pick up the meal this is a special offer from amex for amex card holders only so we're gonna walk through the entire meal with you guys so you can see if it's worth for you to try toca and if you want you can also apply to get an amex card and get these type of deals as well so we just picked up the meal let's get eating so for the appetizer we have burrata it's butternut squash chutney with caramelized papitas uh arugula and grapefruit um and i guess it came with some crostini as well to like go along with it so here we got the crostini with the cheese on top as well as some of the pear it's so crunchy look crostini it's almost like a crouton that cheese is so creamy so so creamy that pear has some really nice like nice sweet flavor to it it really like blends together really nicely on its own it's actually really good too i think it's like buttered up maybe a bit of yeah i think they have a nice layer of butter on there so it's like super crunchy has that buttery texture that butter flavor as well by itself it tastes really great there's like a huge amount of cheese for the amount of crostini so you gotta eat some of it on its own as well the insides are nice and fluffy they're stretchiness almost like mozzarella on the outside of it tastes really really great so some of you may be wondering why a cheese dish with crostini is going to be mixed with some fruit it's because it's so creamy the cheese by itself and even just with the the crostini it's already buttered up so there's a lot of like richness coming from it so you need some type of use something to balance that out and that's where the sauce uh with the arugula as well as that fruit come in to really give it a type of balance so that your mouth isn't just like overflowed with richness i know before i said there might not be enough crostini for all the cheese but i forgot that they gave us two boxes of cristini's so maybe that is enough christine next we got the grilled atlantic salmon and it comes with a base that has some carrots it has mussels and lobster in it as well sauce here saffron butter sauce and it smells like it's infused with some some lobster in there as well it's so so fragrant like you smell it it's so delicious it makes you salivate like right away oh my god that's so good that skin is like grilled like so it's crispy it's nice and crispy it's really really delicious it has a really nice taste to it they season it so perfectly and the salmon is cooked so nicely it's very like nice and flaky it's this this dish is like blowing me away it's really delicious and then some of that uh some of that base with the with the carrots and maybe some potato and the lobster dash will nice oh nice chunks of lobster in here oh my god there's a couple chunks in there under the under the salmon so soft so delicious like lobster you can't beat lobster it's so good found a nice little muscle here soaked up all the flavor oh so good so good this dish is like very very good i would order this like 10 out of 10 times that i go here this is probably like one of the best dishes i've had on this channel so far so next we got the cornish hen with potato chickpeas broccolini and a romesco sauce um right off the bat when you open this up you smell like a huge whiff of like uh of seasoning so i think some type of like rosemary possibly um and like it's just such a delicious smell it smells so good um yeah it's just so good so let's first try some of that cornish hen did you see i even took pieces of breast first a really nice flavor to it seasoned well real nicely so that skin has a little top coat that's a little bit like crunchy to it very nice corner time we've got potatoes i feel like it's been nicely pan fried in some butter with some olive oil looks like there's a bit of basil on top of it like mixed in with it and some pepper as well a really nice flavor to that potato i love how they pan fried it nicely so that there's a slight crispy edge to it and then the middles are still super soft though got this broccolini that's also been uh it looks like it's also been grilled nice taste to it hasn't built like grow to the point where it's like super mushy it's still crunchy and you can hear that right off the bat once you bite into it um and it's nicely seasoned as well it has that same seasoning that i think the potatoes does so now i'm going to try some of that romesco sauce it's almost like like a curry paste you know almost a sense it has it has like it's a really grainy and like it's a really huge pop of flavor huge pop of flavor um but yeah it tastes like there's been mixed in with a lot of different spices to create that sauce and it really complements the the cornish hand very well so i just kind of looked up what a romesco sauce is and it's a combination of things like tomato garlic almonds pine nuts hazelnut olive oil and olives so i guess that's why it's it's like a thicker sauce and it's like noticeably thick like it's not as viscous and like liquid as some other sauces might be and i was completely wrong on that curry take um it just kind of reminded me of that but now knowing what the like the actual ingredients are i i can i can taste it a little bit more we got the lemon tart and it comes with a raspberry sorbet um almond crumble and a raspberry gel it looks so delicious they made it so beautiful and like that char on top they probably torched the the top of that i think it's like meringue on top um and then they they torched the top looks so pretty looks almost too good to eat but you know the flavor is probably just as amazing that crumbled the balance of flavors are so good like some lemon meringues or like lemon tarts like this are way too sour because of so much lemon in it this has a nice like subtle sourness to it but that meringue is so good and just balances all out this is really really delicious unreal really really delicious this raspberry sorbet really really good good the raspberry sorbet is nice uh refreshing um it has a really strong hint of that raspberry flavor which is delicious all in all this dessert is top notch right now i'm eating that top layer meringue on its own and it's it's like softer than a pillow it's just so light so light and fluffy it's unbelievable and get a shot for you guys here so once you put it through there's like a crunch right on the top and then it's so soft and fluffy in the middle it's crazy didn't know ram could be like this so good so good we just wrapped up the meal and let me tell you guys this has probably been the most enjoyable meal that i've had on this channel so far even better than enigma which like i'm sorry to say but i definitely think this place is better so when we picked it up it came in this bag and it's like sealed like those uh those bags that retain heat so that your food is kept either hot or cold depending on which one um even the sorbet they put in little containers with ice cubes inside of another container so that everything is kept to the right temperature um so walking through each of the dishes the appetizer was nice and creamy it was delicious the crostini was so crunchy and had so much flavor from the butter um it was such a nice way to start the meal the atlantic salmon was definitely my favorite and it was so delicious perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned and the smell of that sauce almost smelled like lobster bisque and as someone that absolutely loves lobster bisque that was perfect for me the cornish hen also has some nice flavors um it was grilled to perfection everything was delicious and potatoes i love potatoes that are made that way so that was top notch and that dessert was out of this world that that meringue on top of that lemon tart was insanely insanely fluffy it was like eating a cloud and the flavors were so nicely balanced and not too sour unlike a lot of other lemon tarts so this meal bang on hundred hundred percent do it again even if it's full price i really don't care it's that good you should try it out for yourself try it out at full price you won't regret it at all take that special someone on a nice date here risk carlton is absolutely beautiful so whatever you do i bet you are gonna enjoy that meal so thanks for watching the video leave a like if you enjoyed it and subscribe to the channel for lots more to come and until next time [Music] peace [Music] you",

    "title": "TIKTOK Viral Brunch Box Takeout from Light Café Toronto",
    "description": "Located in Toronto, Light Café's brunch box has been viral all over TikTok, they have a beautiful spread that's aesthetically pleasing and delicious to look at. The restaurant is a Taiwanese inspired Café but I don't really see the influence in the majority of their offering. The box includes various amount of brunch favorites including a croissant, mini pancakes, smoked salmon, waffles fries, egg",

    "transcript": "what's going on today we're going to like cafe to get their brunch box it's been viral all over tik tok we're going to review the entire thing and let you know if it's worth it [Music] so we got back i thought i'd do something more casual today and we're just going to eat straight out of the trunk so we're going to tailgate this and we're going to get on with the review so looking at everything it's a really beautiful display it's really nice looking box i see why everyone's posting on tiktok and instagram it's just very aesthetically pleasing so if you had this boxer for you right now leave in a comment down below what would you start with first i think i'm gonna go with the waffle fries um looks pretty good has a nice crunch to it not too crunchy and you can still taste the potatoes because it's slightly nice and fluffy on the inside these waffle fries are actually pretty good but they don't compare anything close to chicas if you've been to chicas downtown their waffle fries are some of the best i've ever had and honestly they could be some of the best in the entire world you never know next i think i'm gonna go with that croissant it looks nice and fluffy it looks flaky um it looks pretty good actually you see all those layers on the inside that means it's nice and fluffy it's probably going to be delicious to eat it's so nice and flaky it has a nice like buttery outside to it really soft on the inside it's really nice to crumble like crazy so back in my trunk's gonna be filled with some croissant but it's pretty good croissant actually i think they might have cooked it a little too long i can almost taste like a slight little bit of like burnt on it but it's not bad honestly it's pretty good so you get a lot of different choices of what kind of eggs you want i went with the eggs benedict you can get like scrambled you can get sunny-side up whatever you want so i'm gonna try to get you a shot of that runny oak when i first cut into it come here come close well that was a little disappointing uh so when you get like a post egg with some holiday sauce for eggs benedict it's supposed to be runny like really runny so once you cut into it it's supposed to ooze on now it looks really really delicious but unfortunately this one's like almost cooked all the way through which is like very very disappointing that's like that's not the proper way to cook like a poached egg with some hollandaise sauce although the egg was a little disappointing let's see how it tastes though it's not bad the holiday sauce could use a bit more sweetness to it i feel like it's a little a little on the blander side but the egg is tastes pretty good like the at the outside the egg white tastes good um i just wish it were runny man that's all i asked for when i when i order it eggs benedict come on as you can see when you dig to the bottom of that egg there's actually a little bit a little bit of runny yolk i wish there was much more though that would make for much better egg next it looks like we got some breakfast sausage in here as well honestly very standard um same ones you would find out like a hotel breakfast or like very standard stuff like it's nothing special just tastes like a normal sausage i wish they would would have done something like better i wish they had done something like homemade this is not that great we also got some nicely fried up bacon so honestly bacon you just can't go wrong no matter like what kind of bacon you got as long as pork bacon don't don't give me none of that turkey bacon you know but as long as you got this this is always good you can't ever go wrong there's nothing wrong you can do with it you just fry it up and you eat it tastes like basically tastes a little smoky nice and fatty exactly what bacon is everything you love about bacon so when you're ordering the meal you got an option of all these different types of meat so you get like when you have lobster you have smoked salmon you can get i think pulled pork and like a vegetarian option so i went on with the smoked salmon i love smoked salmon so let me tell you a little story when i was back in university it was my study snack i had that frozen uh smoked salmon on my on my desk with some crackers put them together and then got a nice snack for studying that's how much i love smoked salmon [Music] nice smoky flavor texture of the salmon it's so nice it's like the perfect balance of uh raw salmon and cooked salmon and has such a nice smoky flavor to it but honestly this one doesn't taste much different from the frozen salmon that you get at your local go supermarket loblaws or something grab that frozen salmon defrost it you got yourself pretty much the same thing so one thing you've got to do and i'm going to do it right now for you uh you got to get that croissant you got to put some of that salmon onto some of that egg put it all together and have it in one full bite because honestly that is a great amazing combination right here right here so bad that's how you properly eat this combination of food together put all together like a sandwich and you just dig in they put in a garden salad as well so you got these nice green leaves decently fresh um honestly there's not much wrong can go with doing like a garden salad it's just pretty simple it's pretty plain and honestly it feels like a space filler i guess the salad is kind of there just to balance everything else off so that you're not just eating a lot of heavy fattening stuff like hangover food like hangover oily fat food you're not having just all of that you got a little bit of salad there just to make you feel like you're a little healthier so the last and most exciting part are these mini pancakes they look really nice and fluffy got some syrup with it as well to look really nice has a really good flavor on its own even without the syrup it has a good flavor to it and it's nice and soft in the middle actually really good i really like this actually i've been out of all the things here this is the thing that i like most and you can order the entire you can order the same box with just way more of these pancakes too i think that's one of the options you should definitely do that one pancakes also came with a couple of berries nice and sweet some nice fresh fruit really goes well with the entire meal it's like cafe supposed to be a taiwanese inspired cafe but nothing about the maine to me screams out that it's been inspired by taiwan at all honestly they sell like pasta salads and these brunch boxes and nothing really taiwanese about them uh the only thing on their menu that seems taiwanese is their drinks like there might be some like bubble tea kind of flavors and uh like smoothies and stuff like that um so it's a little confusing you know so what are my thoughts on the entire brunch box i really wish that they actually did the egg properly um that would have made the meal a little bit better i wish that does something other than that regular like garden salad very normal very regular a lot of places do it nobody actually most places don't actually do it right or like do it nicely they just kind of throw a salad together and just like toss it there um honestly it's like a forgettable thing on in the entire box it's nothing you don't even need it there like you could put something else there and make it better uh instead of having this random salad you know yeah i think it's very average so there's nothing that really stands out to be like oh yeah this is a great place you gotta try this brunch place out um the pancakes were really great and i think i would get those again the rest of the box was like just you know average and i can't say that i would recommend it over any other like breakfast place that's pretty good like if you talk about emojis temple or something like i can't recommend it over that um this is just very average and like it provides pretty decent value for like 20 bucks you get quite a bit of food um and it's definitely better than getting like a 16 uh avocado toast but will i return to get this again uh maybe maybe i get i come back to get the pancakes again but that's about it to me this meal is like a one and done and like not particularly in a good way so like a good one and done is like zion goes to college for one year goes into the draft goes into the nba this is the bad one where like you enter the draft but you don't make it so like i wouldn't come here again most likely unless like somebody else that i know want to come here with me uh then i'll cope but aside from that i'm not gonna return just for this box um that's my recommendation to you you can check it out if you want to but honestly it's nothing that special it's just really hyped up with tech talk and instagram and all that so if you enjoyed the video let me know in the comments below leave a like on the video and follow me

    "title": "Mini Donuts from COPS & Cubby Smart Kitchen Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich | Toronto Food Tour",
    "description": "We visited COPS Coffee & Donuts to try their mini donuts and Cubby Smart Kitchen for their shrimp po boy and chicken souvlaki! The donuts probably surprised me the most, with their soft texture and delicious combination of flavors. Cubby on the other hand has been talked about a lot due to their covid friendly process to get food. You order from a kiosk, and get your food from a window but I just ",

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're going to two different places so first for the entree we're going to cubby's smart kitchen so this place has like a very modern style to it uh you order from a tablet or like a kiosk on the wall and they have four different styles of food all made in the same kitchen so they got like poke they got i think afghan or middle eastern food they got some burgers and they got uh seafood like po boys so we're going to go there and check it out then we're going to for dessert we're going to cops coffee and donuts and they're really popular right now on tick tock we're gonna try out some of their flavors and see what's good oh so first we got the souvlaki chicken souvlaki it comes with fries rice and obviously the chicken and then they gave us this souvlaki sauce and we're gonna toss a bunch of that in like right now and then mix it all up it smells really good right out right out the gate it smells really really good what i just eat i have no idea what i just put on my mouth but that tastes like an eggplant it was eggplanted there i was expecting it to be chicken so having eggplant is kind of weird now for an actual piece of chicken pretty nice flavor and there's a little it's a little tough and dry though almost like they might have overcooked it a little bit um it's definitely not the best soup okay flavor didn't cook that chicken the best way either no okay dish i guess with the fries it's like a soft cut fry so like you can obviously hear that you don't hear anything when i bite this fry not really much of a crunch to it um the fries taste pretty good they're like nicely seasoned and it tastes like potato next we got this salad that came with the soufflocky it has you can see like there's feta there's some olives some peppers tomatoes cucumbers and it came with this sauce i think it was like a mixture of like olive oil and maybe it's like a vinaigrette maybe so let's see how this one tastes pretty like normal standard salad so really you just got like the raw ingredients and you just kind of put it all together and then you have the sauce that's with it so really any type of flavor that you're getting aside from the natural flavor of like the ingredients it's just that sauce so nothing like really special about the salad it's just like literally anyone can make the salad you just have to find the ingredients bring them home and toss them together you have the same salad so i don't know nothing too special to me so the flavor really comes out from the feta and the sauce mixed together uh that last bite really gets some feta in it so now that i got the feta in a big bite that is really nice with that sauce but the rest of the stuff yeah like honestly you could find some feta at the supermarket same with the sauce mix all together you got the same salad so really you could do this yourself fairly easily one thing i'll say and give them prosper is while i'm eating the salad you can hear that there's a nice like healthy crunch to everything so meaning that it's probably a fresher ingredient so they say they locally they get everything local so like unlike a subway or something where every like piece of vegetable is really sad and limpy this still has a nice crunch to everything so like the ingredients are still quite fresh so next we've got this po boy it's a shrimp po boy um inside i could see that there's um some pickles i think it is um it's covered in some sauce it's like grilled shrimp and then you got the bun and the bottom looks like it's been toasted a little bit i can see like um marks from a grill um but it's not like evenly toasted the marks are kind of like if you can see that it's just like on the bottom and the tops kind of like missing almost the top has those same like grill marks on it so they they put this on the grill for a short while i guess um the shrimp actually has a nice barbecue flavor to it slightly spicy as well when i don't care from this or i think it might have been jalapenos and not like not pickles you got some lettuce in there as well i would say overall knowing this is supposed to be a po-boy i don't think there's enough like toppings inside of it usually po-boys are like filled to the brim you get like this massive sandwich just doesn't like it's not as filled like right now like looking at the sandwich for the pull bar they have like four shrimp in there for this long hot dog bud i don't think that's nearly enough shrimp to be in one hot dog bun um especially when they're not particularly large shrimp either overall i'd say the flavor of the pogba is actually pretty decent i wish it was just filled with more stuff um and maybe the bun toasted a little better or put on the grill for a little longer it has the grill marks but um i don't think there's enough like flavor coming out of the bun but first when we opened up the po boy it looks so sad because some of the shrimp kind of fell out um and some of the ingredients just came out of the came out of the sandwich so it looked kind of sad we put it back in pretty like decent sandwich um just wish there were more toppings it's also eating there's some person driving around in a car pulling their ferret out the window i'm a little a little frightened to be honest with you look do you see it right i thought it was a cat so for dessert we got cops and cops coffee and donuts uh this place is very popular right now it's all over tick tock it's like the line was not that bad it was pretty decent but the wait time pretty nuts so we were there and they said 45 minutes when we got back other people were lining up that was will be an hour away so just like know that in advance you might be better off just ordering off their app or their website and then just like waiting that 30 40 minutes and then picking it up afterwards going there first lining up is not the most efficient way to get your donuts it's got these mini donuts right here um i don't know what flavor they are we kind of ordered two flavors i feel like they just gave us the one or or is it two combined to one they combined the two flavors together so we ordered the weekly special which was french toast and i think it it's mixed in with another flavor and that's the cinnamon icing or cinnamon sugar i'll find out the actual one and then we'll put it in the description somewhere hmm secret flavor actually the donuts have are kind of soft inside they're soft overall and the dough itself is very like has a nice chew to it um you know when like a donut gets dry or like it's been cooked too much it's like really hard it's not like that at all it's nice and soft and then you get like uh some of that flavor from that that cinnamon oh that really like is a really nice flavor that cinnamon mixed in with that uh the sugar glaze um i'm not sure where the french toast comes in but like overall it's like it's pretty good actually i think it's i don't know it's worth the wait it's kind of worth the hype um because it is a really good donut i think if you were to compare this to tiny toms this would be the better one i think this really reminds me of eating cinnamon toast crunch like the cereal really reminds me of that but with a donut obviously we just wrapped up the meal so what are my thoughts on both of these places so first cubbies that chicken souvlaki was only very mediocre like i think i almost prefer mr greek to it and that's not a very high bar so i don't think i would order that again the salad was nice and fresh but i think it lacked like it does it's nothing special about it but the chicken itself kind of dry not a ton of flavor and then the rice was kind of bland so overall it's not like the greatest dish you can have then you got the po boy which honestly right off the bat it looked kind of sad and only came with four shrimp not a lot else going on there um although the flavor of the shrimp was pretty decent i wish there was like way more ingredients it needed much more if i actually just took four bites because of those four shrimp i would have like one third of that bun still left over and i don't know what to do with the one third of the bun overall cubbies i think is like cafeteria or like food co-quality food but they have like their own storefront and it's like a little like it's about the same price maybe a little more expensive than like a food court food um but then you have to actually wait much longer for your food so i don't know really where their value prop is aside from the fact you go to one storefront and you can get like four different styles but they're kind of like uh jack of all trades but master of none so honestly i can't recommend this to anybody i don't think it's worth going to um and i definitely definitely will not be returning then you got cops coffee and donuts that was actually pretty good i like that more than tiny toms it was a nice soft donut the flavor was really good and really reminded me of that like cinnamon toast crunch it was a delicious flavor i would get that again although next time i go i'm definitely ordering ahead of time like an hour ahead of time and then pick it up afterwards and honestly if it gets a little cold it's a donut it doesn't really matter it's still gonna taste great so if you enjoyed this video please leave a like it really helps out subscribe to the channel for lots more every thursday at 4 00 p m eastern time you're gonna get a new video on some delicious food so stay tuned and until next time peace [Music]",

    "description": "Street Eats Market, is an outdoor food truck market in Toronto shopping mall parking lots! They've invited a number of vendors with delicious variety of options and in this video, we review 3 of those options! We got the lobster roll from Buster's Sea Cove, fish, chicken and pork tacos from El Boscos and a Chicken Burger from 6Spice Rack. Each of them were delicious and I'd be happy to eat at any ",

    "transcript": "hi everyone today we're going to street eats it's a food truck setup that got started because of kovid so they they wanted to do an outdoor dining experience so they got food trucks set up all around the parking lot we're gonna head on over to hillcrest mall it's the one with the most food trucks and most variety so we're gonna try two different places out for you and we're gonna review the entire thing let's go [Music] here we got el bosco's tacos we got a fish taco pork taco and chicken and then on this side we have buster's lobster sandwich with some fries everything looks tremendous it looks so pretty in the light let's give it a try where to start i start here with the fish taco [Music] let's start with the lobster roll the lobster is nice and sweet that bun is nicely toasted the buns nicely toasted and buttered up the sauce that they mix it in is like a combination of mayo i think there's like some chives and some like green onions in here it tastes really great it's really flavorful um and the lofter tastes relatively fresh it came with these like small cut fries and they honestly look very similar to like a mcdonald's fry pretty tasty so after eating a couple of these fries i can clearly taste that it's been fried with something different than just regular like canola oil i think maybe you did some like maybe peanut oil i'm not sure because they didn't disclose that it's like there's peanut allergies or anything so maybe it's just a different type of oil but it adds a really different type of flavor almost like a nuttiness to it and it tastes really great it just it's not the same as mcdonald's and obviously mcdonald's is king of fries but these are still some really great fries to eat the lobster also came with this giant pickle oh it's so juicy nice snap to the end of it nice and like a little bit of sourness to it and the pickle's really flavorful i really like that pickle it goes really well with the sandwich and the fries great combination that you find in almost like every sandwich kind of place i always get a pickle on the side and it's delicious so one thing to remember is that both of these came out of food trucks so the lobster is definitely not like right there on the spot they bought the lobster de-shelled it and then like put some put it in the sauce and mix it up it's definitely they already had it pre-made and they toasted the bun so it's nice and warm put that lobster inside and it's still a really great sandwich it's not the same like type of quality you might expect from like a restaurant but it's still very tasty and from a food truck this is actually really great next we got the tacos and tacos are amazing they smell so fresh they smell fragrant they're beautiful they have so much color to them i'm excited to try these ones out let's start with the fish taco you got some like pickled radish i think or pickled cabbage in here looks like a spicy mayo sauce and then some fried up deep fried fish hmm that sausage killer it smells really good it goes so well with the fish there's a slight tanginess to it it's not like just pure spice and mayo it almost tastes like there's a bit of like acidity from maybe some like lime juice or lemon juice really goes well typically like you'll find places that give you the lime or lemon on the side you squeeze it on there yourself i think they've integrated it in with the sauce so that you als already get that flavor and then they control the nice balance of flavors which makes it really really great i really love the sakura next we got the pork taco so it looks like a lot of shredded like pulled pork similar to um some some black refried beans maybe some refried bees in there that pickled onion and got some of that avocado as well looks delicious the meat is nice and soft falls apart in your mouth really delicious flavors i think this is a really good it's been cooked very well i feel like the pork is a little bit on the dryer side it could be a little more flavorful maybe if they pop put like a wet sauce in there it would make it a little more juicy and that will make it even better like this one i'm biting into it the juices aren't like flowing out or anything and a lot of times when you're eating like a pork taco you bite into it those juices are just like oozing out and it gets all over your hands it's a real mess i guess that's one benefit it's not as messy but it lacks a little bit a little bit of that juiciness and flavor that you normally would get with like a pork taco last one here we got the chicken taco looks like there's a bit of cheese it looks like almost like maybe goat or feta you got some caramelized onions instead of pickled onions you got some green onions on top some refried beans this looks good [Music] oh yeah that cheese puts it on the level chicken itself is delicious caramelized onions add a lot of flavor but that cheese on top adds that extra little bit of creaminess that puts it puts it to another level that other chicken tacos might not have and i really love the combination of flavor this year they're really solid really great with the next week and we went back to the street east market and we went to six spice rack this is their south side chick burger so it comes with this ginormous fried chicken rice like smack dab in the middle and you got this bun and all over it is um some lettuce you get some like hot peppers in there they look like they might have been slightly pickled peppers as well and then like buffalo sauce and it's like just drenched with this sauce but that chicken is like it's like this big and then the buns like this so like you have all the chicken just overflowing that burger and it looks so good it's so gigantic you need two hands to get it or else look at that it's about to fall the chicken is so juicy there's some really good flavor in there i think there's a bit of cheese maybe i felt like the pull of a little bit of cheese but i really like how they did this uh fried chicken it's like a little bit crispy on the outside but still so juicy on the inside and that's what you want you want like all the juices flowing out so i don't know if you guys can see this but like it's it's really juicy the peppers are nice and hot but they also have like a sweetness to them so it's not just pure heat and then like that buffalo sauce is actually really really nice and creamy as well so the combination of everything put together is actually really really good the only thing that i'll say is that this bun is getting a little soggy it's like kind of oily too like they've already toasted the bun but i guess it's so sauced up and it's so juicy that like the bun gets a little soggy but honestly in this case i don't really mind it it still tastes really fantastic even with that like you're gonna get all the mess on your hands but it's a very delicious mess um now i'm going to try out some of these fries and they look very similar to like costco fries but and they give us i guess this is may or some type of sauce i think it's like a garlic mayo but it's a really good flavor your mind is similar to like uh the garlic maybe getting like shawarmas but these fries they're very similar to like costco fries costco fries are pretty bomb so these are pretty good as well so we just finished eating everything and let's review each individual item so the lobster roll was very delicious i say it's not exactly like restaurant quality i wish they had like obviously it's asking too much for a food truck to be doing it right when you order to like post a lobster and like do all that work so it was very delicious and for like the price of i think it was 17 bucks that's very worth it it was really good i would do it again uh the fries were also delicious i really like the way they did it with like a different type of flavor to it because of the different types of oil that they used and then the pickle goes along with it so well cuts through it it's like almost like a palate cleanser when you're eating the entire meal and it's very very great for the tacos i thought that the fish taco was definitely my favorite had a great combination of flavors and that sauce was killer it was really really great if anybody tries out this place i guarantee you won't be disappointed with that fish taco the one that i kind of felt like needed some improvement was that pulled pork one it was a little bit on the dryer side but i gotta say this place is very generous with the portion sizing so a lot of other taco places i go to they give you a small taco shell with like very little meat on the inside they kind of stack it up and they have a bigger like a much bigger uh tortilla so that you can enjoy all the flavors and you get like nice and full from it the last one was the chicken and i thought that was also really great it's just below that fish the fish was just my favorite overall this place this burger and fry combo is 14. 14. that's a really good value and i can't believe i didn't find this earlier this is actually tremendous value the flavors are absolutely great they've the execution has done very very well and if i compared it to the other two dishes we got the taco and the lobster the lobster roll this comes out on top this is my favorite i highly recommend that everyone go try this out it's very very good but you can try these off for yourself i'll link it down in the description box below um they're at these malls pretty much every single day of the week most of them some of them are only on like wednesday to sunday but like they have the times on the website you can check it out for yourself and you can try these food trucks as well i think they're really great there's nothing wrong go to a food truck compared to a restaurant they can give you some really great quality food so go try it yourself and i'll see you in the next video peace [Music] you",

    "title": "Korean BBQ at Home | BOGO Deal from Cheongdam, NEW KBBQ Restaurant | Toronto Food Takeout",
    "description": "Korean BBQ is something I dearly miss so we tried a BOGO Deal for Korean BBQ Takeout in Toronto! We got pork butt & k-marinated top blade and a wide variety of banchan (korean side dishes) as well as leafs to make a ssam (wrap). We ordered from Cheongdam Korean BBQ, a new joint that opened up fairly recently that even sell some in house dry aged meats!\n\nCheongdam Korean BBQ: https://cheongdam.ca/",

    "transcript": "welcome back welcome back to what to phil's food review wait wrong language everyone so we got a special dinner meal for you guys here uh we went to chengdu korean barbecue and we got pork butt some some pork butt and some short rib and it's a take home korean bbq so they've already grilled up the meat uh for us they gave us all of the banchan the uh the samjong and the lettuce and i don't know what this leaf is but you see it all over in korea uh to make some some and let's just dig in so i think chengdu is a new place that opened up recently and they when we went inside i could see it on the wall they have their own dry asian lockers so they have different types of meat that they're dry aging in there that's probably something special that you could get if you wanted to uh we didn't go with that option today because they have a special going on right now for takeout and that's buy one get one free so you know can't pass that up that's a lot of food for like the same price that you would normally have to pay like double for so we went with that and we're going to eat all this and review each thing for you start with the meat all right i'm going to go opposite bok choy you don't eat vegetables man stop fooling everyone stop pretending all right first we got short rib let's see how how well they cook this it's decently soft there's not a whole lot of flavor coming to it i expected there to be uh a little more like saucy almost because generally speaking when you go to like a korean barbecue place you get short ribs yeah it's like marinade and certain sauce and this is this was called the marinade short rib yeah so i was expecting a little more marinade um this has a really light taste to it and it definitely tastes like um it's it hasn't been like overclocked it's been cooked like this like relatively nicely visually it doesn't look the best because obviously it's already been grilled and we had to take it home and like you know after a certain amount of time it's not the best let's try some of that pork butt got a big fish nice similar to the to the beef where there's some flavor but not like very pungent um i don't think i don't think there's enough flavor with it um but obviously with korean bbq you you like eat it with a bunch of different sauces you have uh different side dishes that go along with it you make wraps with it so like there's a lot of stuff that you can do to add flavor but i just wish that the meat itself had like a really great favorite to begin with and then all these things just complement on top of that giving credit that the the meat is soft and it's not overly done or undercooked or anything it's pretty good let's get on with it what else do we have here we got some bok choy um i like that it's like nice and spicy yeah what did you get that face for is like two sours on me no there's a spice to it this is bok choy that's what i meant to face this guy hates vegetables so if you see him making any face when you're eating any of a vegetable ignore it he's like the exception to the rule where he just absolutely hates it any type of vegetable he eats he's just not gonna like so uh can't really take his word for vegetables but it has a great flavor they've mixed in some spices it's like a cold dish you know yeah like it's not like they fried it up in a pan or anything it's like a cold dish and they just mix it with a bunch of spices this is something you would chew on just to like refresh a palette kind of thing this corn looks really good it's been like seasoned with um i think some chili powder these are like packed bigger or something too there's not a fresh coin at all it's just going stale isn't it yeah the flavor is a little weird to me too it's candy yeah it's really sweet but like now let me have fresh corn there's like a burst of juice it's like there's like no juice there's no just like just eating the corn kind of like dried out i don't know if this was done on purpose or just like but i don't particularly like that it is very sweet like i thought it'd be a little more spices to it but it's a very sweet glaze yeah the the corn it's like a candies isn't it i'm gonna go for meat again but we're gonna dip it in some sauce they give us some some sauce here and it's like a mixture of salt and sesame oil so maybe this will add some acid flavor to this meat it definitely adds some fragrance sesame oil has really strong flavors to it so it adds a nice fragrance to it try some of this kimchi i'm curious how this kimchi is i'm not a fan of it like most kimchi actually um i like your kimchi's are fresher and spicier i mean the only good kimchi's ever had was in korea so yeah that's true this is not bad it's uh there's no strong sourness to it because it's been pickled and then you've got the spice coming out as well so like the spice is actually more spicy than i think most other kimchi is that you usually find in in like canada or toronto but this one's actually pretty good i actually like this one what do you think i don't find it that sour actually i've had waste our more sour kimchi than this but it is definitely a more on the spicy side compared to the average korean restaurants you find here um it's nice though it's nice and refreshing it's it's not like too spicy or too sour it's good all right so the next thing we have to do is create a sound so when you're eating korean barbecue you are served with a bunch of lettuce or this other vegetable i'm actually not sure what this is leave it in the comments section below if you know what it is let me know but grab this um you put in your meat you put in whatever side dishes you want uh and then you put some samjhan and it's gonna taste completely different it completely changes up the flavor profiles just like all that mixed together so i'm gonna put short rib um this spicy green onion salad some of these onions i think they came with a sauce i don't know what's in the sauce it's like a vinegar kind of sauce just like a vinaigrette kind of almost uh some samjong so then you got this i got my son some to eat cheers i think that almost adds like a liquor flavor do a liquid flavor to this dude not fat licorice it's probably not for you this is not for me liquidation is okay you're not a huge fan though the rest of the flavors are good the beef is nice and tender got some spice from that green onion salad and you got some of the crunch from the onions and samjong always adds a ton of flavor samsung is always so good the best if you don't know what song changes it's like um soybean paste that's right soybean paste there's two containers here one has some some spicy garlic the spicy sauce mixed with some garlic the other side just has like peppers and garlic um you can mix it all up to eat together i'm gonna do lettuce this time do with the pork i forgot last time to put it in the sesame oil dressing some of that spicy it's actually quite spicy this uh green onion salad yes it's a nice kick it was it was definitely yeah it was definitely a nice spicy kick to it um i felt like this onion these onions mixed with a sauce it could have been more sauce they didn't like give us a whole lot um generally when we went to our favorite place to go to always is um i'll link both of these in this description box below but they give you like this bowl of onions with a sauce in it and when you dip the meat in there or like you get some of that onion it soaks up it sucks up all the flavors and it adds so much it adds like it's like vinegary it's kind of sweet it adds so much to the meal when you have that um and i felt like that missing a bit of that sauce but it's hard for me to give you guys like a full assessment of the meat because obviously they cooked it ahead of time um took us maybe like 20 minutes to get back here and filming and all that stuff so like i don't want to say that it's 100 100 percent worse than a and like i don't ever want to return i would like to try it once in the store to see what the experience is like if it's different from this but so far like as a takeout dish i'm not really excited about this i was looking forward to a much better quality korean barbecue when i saw this unfortunately this didn't meet my expectations um maybe it korean bbq should just be left for in-store dining maybe that's the thing maybe once i go in person it's gonna be great but we'll find out when that happens but until then you guys can leave in the comment section below what's your favorite korean barbecue place and like the video subscribe to the channel for lots more food reviews because i'm going to give you the truth i'm not going to hold anything back you guys hear the honest honest truth out of me so until next time peace you",

    "transcript": "hi everyone another amex offer came through and it is for italy so italy is a premium italian grocery store and they have tons and tons of delicious stands that sell pasta pizza cured me cheeses everything you can think of when you think of italy they sell it there and they've come out with this package and it comes with so much food and it's only 75 bucks with this am i softer and i looked up each individual dish and when you add it all up together it's 150 bucks so we're getting it for half off this is an exciting meal at such a fantastic place uh let's head on over and get that meal [Music] the first salad we got has some arugula has lettuce has radish some macadamia nuts and uh some parmesan like slices of parmesan cheese and it looks really good smells very fragrant like they also gave us a vinaigrette so i think it was like olive oil some salt and pepper this looks so good nice and fresh you hear the crunch from the vegetables the vinaigrette's really tasty too adds like a smooth texture to it and you got some of that salt and pepper adding flavor [Music] nice crunch from that macadamia the macadamia nuts add some nice texture and flavor to it like a little bit of nuttiness it's really really nice the vinaigrette is really nice adds so much flavor and this salad is really good the next salad has some baby arugula some cherry tomatoes and some parmesan cheese parmesan slices again it has a very similar dressing i think it was also olive oil with salt and pepper let's give this one a try i love that saltiness that comes out from the cheese really tops off the entire salad really nicely and got like a healthy hearty arugula with it and cherry tomato pop flavor little cherry tomatoes really nice add some like sweetness from the tomato once you pop it it's just like so much flavor comes out if you ask me which one i prefer i honestly like this one with the cherry tomatoes i think it's a little more simple than the other one but the flavors mixed all together work really nicely like in harmony it's just like a symphony playing at the orchestra everything's like all the flavors are just popping off right at the right time and they all mix well so well together so on to the mains we got this delicious delicious pasta it has a tomato based sauce and then you got tons of seafood so you got shrimp you got uh you got some i think this is salmon you got mussels um oh you have a little bit of squid just found some squid in here too um it smells very flavorful uh you can really smell those tomatoes coming out of it first bite i really like that flavor um you get the brightness from the tomatoes i think they might use a bit of wine like sweetness from a white wine or something to like cook uh cook some of the seafood cook the pasta in or the sauce as well you get some of that a different type of sweetness not just from tomatoes but you got a little bit of that extra sweetness from i think it's a white wine but it's really nice flavor it just comes off right right at the end there like almost like an aftertaste so salmon i think there's salmon yeah try out the salmon it's so nice and soft the texture is really nice and it has good flavor like it's really nice soft piece of salmon there here's a nice piece of squid um nice and chewy soaked up all the flavor from those tomatoes flavor is really nice and really pops got some shrimp cook really well not that not like overcooked so if you're overcooked it's going to taste like rubber nice and chewy and honestly they've done a very good job with this pasta so one thing i think you can really tell when you're eating this is that they use real tomatoes in it so you have like the skin you see some seeds in there so they're not just using like some tomato paste or like buying some of that like you know that the canned pasta sauces those have like none of that in it because it's just like it's all just been processed out this one you can tell they've actually used those type of ingredients it's fresh um it's light and it's refreshing it's very tasty pasta this next one is an angon ladi it looks like it's mixed in with a pesto and it's it has some of these little bits of asparagus i think if you remember my i think like second video at richmond station also has some angle lottie let's compare the two and see which one is actually better it's really nice and cheesy but i think it says goat cheese in it and like i do like goat cheese but in this i don't think it works as well i don't know what they put in the angle lottie at richmond station gown was really bomb i honestly prefer that one over this one i think that one's way better but at the same time this is this has great flavors as well and if you like goat cheese this might be the one for you this is still a really good pasta and it's worth ordering again the pasta is cooked this the outside layer is very nice and soft i think they actually put some shaved parmesan on top too and it's been melted in there so you get a little bit of that saltiness on top and then the base of that pesto sauce is nice and like the olive oil is really fragrant and the herbs add like a really nice flavor to it accompanying the main is these fried ball and like looks like fried toast i have no idea what these are i'm gonna bite into each one and show you what's inside first one hmm what is that there's some herbs i think it's potato and it almost tastes like a hashbrown almost but like an elevated hashbrown and it has a little bit more like savory textures to it this one looks very similar so i'm assuming it's the same but we'll bite into it and find out yup exactly the same really delicious though i really like the flavors coming out of there it's nice and soft but the outside is really really crunchy this one honestly looks like a meatball a fried meatball it looks very interesting what is that look at this it's like tomatoes inside like tomato based flavors inside the tomato sauce and i think this is what i scooped up from the insides it's almost like i think it's almost i think it might be rice inside there either rice or like shavings of potato i can't really tell which one it is or maybe it's a form of pasta but something within that realm stuffed inside with herbs a tomato sauce and then like they fried it inside this ball i have no idea how they did it but hey it's really delicious lastly we got this square and to me it automatically looks like french toast but i doubt it's french toast um let's let's find out um it's like a it has some like peas in there um and i think it's potato like now that i'm like i'm looking at this it has to be potato right it has to be it it tastes like there's strands of potato um it's been seasoned maybe there's some cheese in there as well and then they put some peas look at that these are all like really good i like how the crust is so nice and crunchy really nice crunch on the outside and the inside's nice and soft and has it's packed with flavors this is really surprising to me and so far i i don't know man this this is like the one thing that's actually like got shock on my face like i look shocked i feel like on camera we have this giant pork chop um there's a lemon there some sea salt looks like some coarse salt but it's already it's already been salted it looks like there's pepper on it too but this thing's massive it's like the size of my hand if you can see that it's the size of my hand you know what for this one i'm just gonna use my hands so there's no crunch on the outside slightly juicy on the inside it could be more juicy though might be a little more cooked but like that's hard to do with a pork chop especially when you're frying it but there's some really nice flavors coming out you really taste that pork the salt and pepper obviously adds that flavor to it the juices are flowing out of that pork chop are really flavorful it's packed with flavor i think like this is like a giant schnitzel with the bone still in tastes great it's nice accompaniment to the pastas and you have some meat with it on the side for dessert we have this delicious tiramisu it looks great it smells amazing you get all that like coffee the coffee smell coming out of it and it looks super creamy oh you get like a whiff of that coffee it reminds me of like the fragrance of like a coffee crisp or nicely fresh food coffee in the morning that's so good it's so so creamy it's rich it's sweet so the base of this is like those ladyfingers and it's nice and soft um it's not like hard and stale like you might find with like some type of breads like that and then you got such a creamy filling inside and the topping of all that uh coffee coffee flavor powder on top it is really good i really like this tiramisu and i really think you should try it for yourself overall what did i think of the entire meal well first off italy is such a cool like cool spot because you can have so you can get so many different things and if you're looking for italian food or an italian market to like get your groceries this is like the place to go they have just about anything you want to find and you'll find things here that you will not find in any other supermarket but let's go on to the food the salads were really great i like the sauces that they gave us and the out of the the parmesan on top of both of those salads with the arugula all the flavors mixed in together were very like they mixed in very well then we got the pastas both of the pastas were pretty good although i would say that they aren't the best pastas i've had so if you want a bigger a better angladi you go to richmond station i think if you want another seafood pasta taroni is a great spot where you can get one that i would say is like better quality then you got the pork chop which was nice and flavorful all although i think it could have been a little more juicy um it was a little on the drier side it did have that flavor i would say it did have flavor but i feel like it could have been juicier those like fried rice balls those were actually really good they surprised me a lot i haven't had many opportunities to actually eat that so this being one of those times i felt like that was really really great and like people should really come here and try it out for themselves maybe i'm wrong and there's some place doing it really well and like much better but i don't know any so if you know leave it in the comments down below that tiramisu was also fantastic i would eat that shiramisu any day it rivals some of the best tiramisus in toronto i would say there's not a lot of places that do it really well and this is actually pretty good for one that you can get out of a grocery store it's like pre-packaged it's really great flavors so overall i would say i would 100 recommend people try this out um italy is a fantastic place to go and visit just to do your shopping and also to get a quick bite so the meal we got since it was like only 75 bucks instead of the 150 like 100 that's the deal of a lifetime but if you have to pay the full 150 um it is a ton of food we didn't finish it you're gonna have for leftovers so i would say yeah i will get some of these items but not as much as they actually gave us but overall highly recommend people check it out eelies all over the world they have places in new york and london um they're everywhere so they're obviously doing a great job at what at like giving their product offering i hope you guys enjoyed the video leave a comment down below of what you

    "transcript": "man not in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're going to plant a queen so my first video that i ever posted on youtube was planet yorkville go check that out if you haven't seen it i'll put it up in the description i think it's this corner um check that out first watch this one after so this one is they're completely different in terms of what they serve on their menus that one at yorkville serves more western food so you got like lasagnas you got pastas you got different salads this one is more like an asian fusion you got different types of sushi or mackie as well as like fried rice dumplings and things like that so i'm joined with ogpk boy and half of the hungry siblings and ogpk boy hates vegetables absolutely hates them so we're bringing him to a vegan place so he can see for himself that there actually is great vegetable great vegan food out there so today we ordered the queen classic so it comes with i guess a wide variety of different items on their menu that's like their signature dishes we also got the sushi platter and let's see how they [Music] are [Music] m i got these gills and dumplings i don't even know what's in them i think some like mushroom and some other vegetables i think there's carrot in it it's pretty good like the crust is all right it's not as crunchy as i thought it'd be but it's very fragrant inside i'm not sure what the fragrance is from though yeah i think it's like a combination of like different vegetables so i think like i i guess some like carrot taste out of it and like a bit of the mushroom but it's actually it's a pretty decent dumpling it's like it's not bad it's pretty good i think the dumplings need it to be a little more fried like the gyoza dumplings would have been nicer it feels a little more fried on the outside um the filling was actually all right it's pretty good um i do kind of wish it was meat though but i guess we are eating vegan food so you can't put that inside overall i think we all agree that um it would have been nicer with meat inside and the vegan version is not as great as like if you were to put some meat in it all right so the next one we got the slaw and it honestly does like when you first open it doesn't look very appealing it comes with a sauce and we just pour it all over it um you got like what some cabbage um a little bit of basil some coriander some onion i'm gonna get like the most sauced up the most sauced up point in this and uh let's see how this tastes it's like a strong whip of coriander holy crap like a licorice flavor there's something shredded in here as well that has like very strong licorice taste so it tastes like licorice and coriander oh and honestly that's not a great combination for me i don't think it is a great artist unfortunately it's kind of like it's like a spicy salad because of that because of that uh licorice taste it's almost like a floral taste to it i think it's like if you mix floral uh licorice coriander all together and create a salad this is kind of what it is really not flavors that i particularly like so to me not a great salad yeah on to the next one next one we got is the xo tofu exo fried tofu so it's like an exo sauce um if you're asian you probably know what this is but um it gives a very like sweet savory flavor to it um and then it's right on top of that fried dumpling or no fried tofu sorry fried tofu it's really fragrant outside the box though like once you open it you get a whiff of that exo exo sauce pretty nice tastes good totally nice and soft it's fried nicely it's not too heavy of a batter and then you got like the actual sauce that like adds that kick of flavor and that's really where like most of the flavor custom is from the exo sauce and the rest is just like kind of texture but it's a really nice tofu and not much unlike regular like chinese dishes that you find that's a really strong exo flavor because they just kind of toss it right on top of that tofu whereas in some other places they mix it in with a sauce that has like a bit of vinegar in it and it like it won't be as strong of a punch it has a more balanced flavor this is like it kind of packs a punch with that exo sauce um because it's just like by itself right on top of that tofu i like it so far felix is a journey through uh yeah but like that's like universally bad for all of us yeah we got the noodles um comes with these egg noodles uh it comes with some cilantro on top as a sauce with these like i guess these like beans i'm not actually sure what they are um i'll try to find them in the description but yeah it comes with this sauce um so it's like egg noodles with kamut it says in the description um traditionally i think it's egg noodles with it's like a spicy and it's like a peanut based sauce um this doesn't smell like or seem like it has any peanut in it but we'll see what the first bite has a nice fragrant flavor to it it has slightly a nutty flavor to it but i'm not sure it's exactly peanut it might be a little bit like a small hint of it or like a sesame sauce in it and then this adds more like a i don't know if this like really adds much to it i don't know what kamut is this honestly reminds me a lot of like a bolognese sauce um where this this commute is creating like a thicker sauce with some texture to it almost similar to like what um in bolognese sauce like a meat would um but it has like that same kind of reminiscence of a donda noodle but not exactly we all just realized that this can't be an egg noodle or else that wouldn't be vegan right so i don't know exactly what it is it's reminiscent of an egg noodle um i don't think it tastes like has that fragrance of the egg but it's still it's not like a very great dish it tastes very good it's like not like exactly what i would think a danda noodle is though um so it's like their own take on it i guess overall i think this looks more like a dundal noodle than it does actually tastes like one they put their own like kind of style and mix into it um and it tastes really great but to call it da da noodle i don't think it's like close enough to the traditional one to be called the dun dun noodle all right so next we got the pineapple fried rice it smells super fragrant you got some cashews in there some pineapple um and like it smells like it's been fried with like a lot of sesame oil too which adds like a ton of flavor and fragrance so let's take this first bite it's really nice it's like it's nicely fried and then like the pineapple gives it like a pop of like a juice of that juice so it's like not so dry of like a fried rice like some fried rices are like really super dry um when you add the pineapple in there adds that little bit of juice and then you just got some like cashews to add some like some crunch to it as well pretty solid fried rice i don't think anybody would be disappointed eating this we got the sushi box and try one of each this one's what i'm really like uh interested in because without like sushi mainly you put uh some type of fish or some type of like seafood on it but seeing as vegan can't have any of that so is the substitute really gonna taste the same or is the flavors gonna be there i guess we'll find out so let's take a first bite of this thing i have no idea what this is this looks like avocado with some cream sauce on top and then it's been like torched all right i think that's like cream cheese on top i hate cream cheese any type of sushi i swear to god i think that's cream cheese i'm not exactly sure i'm not hundred percent sure i know i don't like it and the rice is very like very just like mediocre it's like i don't think there's enough vinegar in there there's not really enough flavor coming out of the rice but holy that that like that cream cheese just masks everything i don't even taste avocado all i taste was cream cheese and with like a bit of rice nah man that in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible this next one has some like cashews on it has avocado maybe thin slices of tomato that looks similar to like a salmon and then the middle looks like that same vegetable that produces that licorice flavor um yeah i'll give it a bit liquor's flavor just something that like reminds me a little bit of like like a little bit of tuna that thing on the top i don't know what it is it's a little reminiscent of like the texture of tuna a little bit of the flavor but the combination of flavors to this one is actually not bad it's pretty good um does it do it for me like a tuna would definitely not you can't beat tuna but the flavor for this is actually pretty good it's not bad uh the next one is like a california roll with like avocado once again i feel like avocados and everything here um and then there's another thing that kind of looks like like a faux tuna i don't know i don't know what they use to make make that though i mainly just taste that spicy sauce not really a lot of anything else going on avocado is like a little bit creamy but um yeah it's just like like really creamy with like tiny bit of rice and all i taste is that sauce on top everyone says anything else so this compared to other types of like spicy salmon sushi or something that you at least get some of the texture out of that tuna or the salmon um i don't really get much out of that at all so this next one's this crispy rice thing and once again it looks like it has avocado um and that fake the faux tuna and some like rice krispies on top i don't know which one's all right i think out of all them i might like this one the best because it has different texture it's like it's not really sushi so it's like its own its own thing and then avocados creamy and then the faux tuna um tastes pretty nice it's not there's nothing like that blows my mind for any of these things but this is the this is probably like my favorite out of the bunch so for dessert they gave us a gelato it is a little melted now because we ate everything else and ate this last um i think it was strawberry gelato yeah strawberry gelato uh honestly you can't go wrong with gelato man just tastes good this just tastes like a standard gelato it also came with this other dessert it's sago with uh i think this mango some mango some grass jelly in it too it's like a sago dessert tastes pretty good it's like a it's a nice dessert it was like coconut tapioca with some it seems like mango some grass jelly this tastes really good i i love this type of dessert mangoes are nice and sweet too so we just wrapped up the meal we had so many different things so i'll just tell you what i didn't like and what i did like so i really didn't like that salad that slaw um i thought it was like way too floral in flavor it just didn't sit well with me in my mouth um that's definitely something i don't recommend getting um the sushi platter like for somebody that isn't vegan and i i love eating sushi and raw fish there's no replacement for it this didn't do it for me at all there's things a lot of things there that i didn't like uh that cream cheese type uh sushi the licorice slaw inside one of the sushis um i just felt like the overall balance of flavors really wasn't there whereas like in actual sushi i get that balance of flavors and i get like some really delicious bite so i think my favorite from all the dishes were the daener noodles as well as the fried rice the pineapple fried rice those are both really great i would have them any time no doubt in my mind the desserts were also fantastic but i mean that's not really specific to like a vegan place just sago's really good in general uh sorbet is also very delicious so like there's no going wrong with either of those things the dumplings the gyoza dumplings i felt like i would have preferred having meat in them instead of the vegetable filling with carrots and mushrooms and then that tofu was very delicious as well it was kind of standard so like you could find something similar in a lot of other places but they did it very well i would order it again and i would eat it so let me know what you think about all the food that i tried if you've had it before too let me know if there's other vegan food places that i should check out and thanks for watching the video

This is a local business create by a great friend of ours, the sauce has a kick of heat, with a tangy touch and goes perfectly with oysters and wings! You can get the sauce at both McEwan Don Mills and McEwan TD, Fresh & Wild Food Market and their website.",

    "transcript": "best i ever had what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're reviewing six heat birds eye chili um this is ogpk boy you might have noticed him in the last video i'll link that uh in the annotation box somewhere but we're gonna review this we have a whole wide array of food here we got some oysters from diana oyster bar we got some tiger shrimp jumbo tiger shrimp from tnt yeah yeah we also all-star wings just plain naked wings so we can get all the flavor from the sauce and some chicken nuggies because you just got it [Music] all right so first we're going to try it out with some of the shrimp just dip it in get all nice and all over the shrimp great do it cheers bro um what's wrong with the shirt you feel that shrimp huh that wasn't me that's probably you probably man just ate a bunch of stuff but there's like a kick a nice kick of heat and it almost reminds me of like buffalo flavored wings like buffalo flavor you know kind of yeah it was pretty well i've had this sauce before right but i've never had with seafood like a shrimp it's pretty good with the shrimp but i think that maybe it's better with some meat all right we're trying with some of these chicken nuggets and dunk them dunk them all over the sauce i don't know how i like it with the with the chicken nuggets oh my god there's two hibiscus like runny yeah maybe a little too runny for for chicken nugget dipping sauce like these chicken nuggets you gotta really eat it with something sweet yeah they need something sweeter or like super salty like ketchup it's like most of the dipping sauces from mcdonald's is gonna be us on the sweeter side but this isn't really um sweet it has like a more there's like vinegar in it so it has like more of a i don't know more of a savory more of a savory tone to it than like a sweet one a little zest in it a little heat yeah it's like a little bit of acidity with the vinegar and then like i don't think that really goes well with the chicken nugget but it probably tastes bomb with those with those wings though hold on let's give it a try go for a drumstick bearing techniques for sure they're like perfect with chicken yeah nice you can have this as like the what number number two number three sauce on hot ones yeah calling you out hot ones try out the sauce put it on your channel this is good i definitely think this is much better than it being on both the shrimp and the chicken nuggets well i guess like that's most hot sauces just messed with chicken wing yeah so here we're going to try with some of these like these massive oysters when i first tried this sauce i tried it on its own and i felt like it was a mixture of like almost like a seafood sauce with spice but obviously after we're eating this it doesn't really taste like that it's more zesty so i don't know how it's actually going to be with these oysters i thought initially it might be great with oysters but let's try it out let's try it whenever you're ready bro cheers naturally when you eat oysters a lot of people already put vinegar they put like some lemon juice in it so like you get that zest and then you also add like hot sauce to oysters sometimes so this is like a perfect mixture it has some of that heat has a bit of vinegar has that zest so it's like a combination of all the flavors that you normally would put on oyster yeah all packed into one so it actually tastes really good with oysters so this sauce one of our friends actually created it so full disclosure this is a product our friend created but we love it enough to promote it as well so we're not getting paid nothing no sponsorship nothing like that we just really like the sauce and it's one of our good friends so i think this is a fantastic sauce so when we were at a cottage he actually gave us samples to try yeah he had i think even before the cottage he had like 14 different samples of sauces he came over to my place and we just tested them all out and he did this with a couple groups so this one the bird eye was the one that rained supreme it's like the more on the spicier side but overall they kind of kicked it down a notch for the end result so it's it's it's a balance of there is a kick but it's also very good flavor very light and acidic and has strong like citrus flavors into it too yeah so after all that he came out with this final product and it actually tastes really great you can get the sauce if you're interested downtown at mcewens and wild and fresh on cane spadina so these two grocery stores do sell his sauce and you can also get this online on their own website so we'll link it down in the description box below you guys can check it out if you want to buy it i highly recommend you try it out it's actually a really good sauce if you want to compare this to like a tabasco like tabasco's really plain it's very normal um i don't think it's that great of a hot sauce this is fantastic you put on a lot of different types of food like out of these four here we really liked it with both the oyster and the chicken wings not so much the shrimp or the nuggets but i mean every sauce is complemented uh compliments a different food really well and we think these two are the ones that were good so six heat just like its namesake comes from the six so the gta is a local business so if you want to support local i highly suggest you buy this hot sauce try it out for yourself um and drink you from the six right come on help support some hot sauce help support a small business man if you enjoyed the video what do you do felix smash that like button that's right you subscribe to the channel leave a comment down below is there anything else you want us to review just let me know in the comments and until next

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to phil's food review if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button for tons of food adventures and hit the like button if you enjoy it really helps with that youtube algorithm so today i'm taking you to somewhere so exciting i was so excited when i heard about this place it's called enigma fine dining it's in yorkville the luxury part of town and the chef has some great experience chef quinton bennett has international experience working in cities like cape town south africa all the way to vancouver canada some of his most notable experiences include being a trainee for three months at noma which is in copenhagen known for their redefining of nordic cuisine has previously ranked best restaurant in the world and is now ranked number two with two michelin stars after that he was a senior sous chef for several years at northcote in england serving modern british cuisine and also has one michelin star with that extensive experience he's come to toronto to create his own restaurant named enigma fine dining so one thing i got to tell you guys before we actually start eating the food is that when you order it and you pick it up from their store you have to bring it home with you and you have to put them in the oven so anything that needs warming up they give you this set of instructions for each dish on how you should warm them up before you eat them so that's just one thing to know before we start the meal so we ordered two sets so the first set we got the potato as an appetizer and then we got the patheti which is a puff pastry with red like a vegetable filling inside and the last one we got was an apple crumble and then the second set we got ratatouille with a beef wellington and the beef wonkton serves two people and it's an extra 40 bucks if you wanted to beef wellington the third thing we got was the bread pudding so now let's enjoy the meal this first dish i think is called gratin and it's potato slices and some cream so it looks super creamy it smells delicious this little charred on the top here it's so nice and soft it's really really creamy like i can't imagine how soft these potatoes are really they're like on a next level of sauce like they've been like been cooking and boiling for like hours that's how soft it is and it's just like it melts in your mouth it's so creamy and that flavor is like so rich it's so good the next dish is the ratatouille and unlike the movie um that cartoon where they laid it out really nicely in a circle ratatouille is not really like that it's a stewed vegetable dish so it's gonna look more more so like more or less like this um so let's see how the flavor is though here you can see there's a bit of i think those are cucumbers you got um eggplant you got tomatoes you got bell peppers it's a whole wide array of vegetables that sauce is really nice not sure it tastes tomato based of course maybe with some basil inside it has a really nice light flavor it does taste like you've been stewed um the vegetables are nicely nicely cooked but not overcooked and super mushy they're not undercooked and super crunchy they're like perfect level so this next one is called the fibier i think it's it's a puff pastry stuffed with a bunch of different vegetables and here we got a vegetable juice and then kale i'm just going to cut this right open and then pour some of the sauce right in oh immediately from that crunch you hear it from the from the puff pastry it's super super flaky and right there you see a nice layer of vegetables i can smell a lot of mushroom coming out of this actually so here we got a bit of that vegetable juice just gonna pour it all over it that's nice mmm it's like a sweet a sweet flavor to that that puff pastry is so light so fluffy it's so flaky too it really crumbles in your mouth you can get a whiff of like all that vegetable inside i think there's a lot of mushroom in here like i really have that smell coming from it i'm not i'm not 100 sure but it really tastes good it's such a great flavor the insides are insane and mixed with that sauce that sweetness of the sauce mixed with that vegetable it's so good now that i dig more closing it's almost like there's a maybe a little bit of like squash or there's definitely onion in here maybe some squash or pumpkin also really nice creamy insides to it with that flaky outside it's like a it's like a perfect vegetable pie oh and now some of the kale that goes along with it looks like it's in a cream sauce it's nice and creamy and like a lot of times when you eat kale it's very hard and get really earthy flavor coming out of it this doesn't it's like cooked to perfection it's like just tastes like a very soft vegetable which is typically not really what you get from kale it's really nicely done kale and that creaminess of the sauce is really nicely complementing it yeah i really like this it's like a it's a kale slaw almost in a sense last but certainly not least for the entrees is the beef wellington this is got me so excited it looks so good if you could smell the just the smell of the puff pastry it's like it's so good it's so good it just like makes you like start drooling oh my goodness it's so flaky oh my god you see that middle it's cooked perfectly perfect like medium rare you get the really nice whiff of that beef tenderloin and it's so juicy the juices are already flowing out wow so flaky and beef tenderloin in there just melts in your mouth it's so soft it's not chewy at all and melts in your mouth right when it goes in and pass a punch with flavor that's so much flavor coming out of it juices are really flowing out it's capturing nicely in there so that the juices don't like when you're when it's fully baked juices don't leak out and like make the puff pastry very like very soggy it's really nicely done the crust is amazing like it's just it's absolutely perfect it's so nicely seasoned too there's no way you got this kind of flavor at any normal restaurant this is like really good quality meat really well done puff pastry i'm sure they even they did everything in house it's like so flavorful so good i'm gonna like devour this in a matter of seconds so the beef wellington also came with uh a truffle juice so i'm going to try this this it smells so fragrant like that truffle flavor was coming out hmm you just get a huge whiff of truffle right when you dip it in when you put in your milk get that truffle instantly it really complements it it infuses so nicely with that beef the truffle and beef combinations just out of this world you really gotta try this for yourself and once you try it i don't think you'll ever go back to another place for beef wellington so our first dessert that we got is the apple crumble and it came with this sauce right off the bat after it comes out of the oven you smell tons of caramel on that apple and it's like perfectly caramelized and like melts it up all together it looks really good and it smells amazing i wish you could smell this it's so soft hmm what a crunch under that crunch from i think it's the caramelized um caramelized sugar on top you know it's so nice and then like the apple it just melts in your mouth like some of them have like chunks of apple i think they have like really thin layers here so that when you're cutting through it it's like perfectly buttery smooth and it just packed with so much flavor it's such a great flavor um there's not many apple crumbles that could get much better than this it's so good as you as i'm eating this i realize it's like a nice whiff of cinnamon and caramel as well and it's so nice um the flavors melt melt together so well it's like a melting pot of all these flavors and it just like swirls around your mouth like with so much aroma it's so beautiful this next one we got is the bread pudding and as i'm looking at it there's like a ton like there's a sauce all over it it looks like it's caramel um maybe i'm wrong i'll i'll see what it is when i bite into it there's some whipped cream on the side and some pistachios over top of it on the box it said croissant pudding so i guess this is a type of croissant that they put instead of like any normal type of bread so i think it is a caramel cream the bread is really nice that caramel adds ton of flavor and the bread has i think some raisins inside and as like when you bite into it as like that kick of flavor all the juices just pop through after taking a couple bites of the bread pudding i realized that there's no it's not much of a croissant at least i don't think it is um it tastes like just like some bread and then with some like raisin bread and then covered with caramel some whipped cream and um the caramel for sure adds like tons of flavor it's really nice so we just wrapped up the meal um overall whatever i think of this place um i think if you dined in it would be so beautiful the environment is amazing i'm sure the plating would be so great as well it's going to be beautiful to your eyes before you eat it um having a takeaway like you obviously don't get that part of the experience but the food itself is really really great so out of the appetizers i like the potato more than the ratatouille ratatouille i don't know i don't see many places that are able to really like elevate ratatouille rather he's like a stew right so it's one of those things that can be done very well and they did um but i don't know what like next level um you can put to it so for the for the mains the entrees i like both of them a lot so the puff pastry was like perfect super flaky uh it's like so so nice to eat um and it's done very well like the beef wonky is a lot though so if you're ordering it like it does tell you it's for two people i just wanted to get it because i want to try it um but it is a really huge portion but it tastes great so if you really want to get that that's one i would definitely recommend um if you get the other one the the vegetable with the puff pastry um that's also very solid very great um and in terms in terms of the desserts i preferred the apple crumble i think that was a top-notch apple crumble like i don't think any place i've ever been to beats that but the bread pudding was like all right i didn't think it was like at that same level as that bread pudding so right now given that everything's takeout um this is like a tremendous value so for 40 bucks you can get all the work you get the appetizer you get the main although i must say there's only two choices for the main at that 40 price point and it that's one of the the puff pastry with the vegetables as well as i think it was a fish everything else if you want something different you have to add a little bit more money but honestly the beef wanted an extra 40 bucks i think that's completely worth it and then dessert like you and you also get dessert with the meal so for 40 bucks i think that's tremendous value um you should totally get this bring it home um bake it up and then eat it you won't regret the meal at all um so huge recommendation huge applause to the chef here did a fantastic job everyone should check it out um if you liked the video please hit that subscribe button down below leave a like let me know in the comments section what other fine dining restaurants are

    "description": "We went on an incredible signature pizza tour visiting 4 restaurants in Downtown Toronto. We went to Queen Margherita Pizza, Blondies Pizza, Conzo's Pizza and 8 Mile Detroit Style Pizza. Queen Margherita was definitely the best with their flavorful dough, sweet tomatoes and creamy mozzarella cheese. Watch through the entire video to hear my thoughts on all these pizza joints.\n\nThe 2021 All-Star Ga",

    "transcript": "i don't even think it's like significantly better than the dominoes hey what's going on welcome back to phil's food review i'm here with my boys og pk boy and nick and we're out here trying to do a signature pizza challenge so we're just gonna go around to different places around the city get their signature pizzas and we will review it for you [Music] got queen margarita pizza the tomatoes are really sweet cheese is nice and creamy a bit of olive oil on top and the crust is perfect this is like the best margarita pizza in the entire city maybe aside from like gilaweta possibly like that's the only one that like really rivals this to me like this is what i expect from a margarita pizza like a floppy across not so hard and like crunchy but soft and chewy and then you get like sweetness from the tomatoes obviously you get like a nice like creamy cheese like sometimes the cheese tastes like plastic and i hate that because obviously cheese isn't supposed to taste like plastic we got blondie's pizza uh you can't miss the building it's like all pink that's all you can see the boxes are pink so when you get in there uh we ordered the pizza and it took a long time so just be aware of that every single place i guess because it's a friday night that's our fault takes about like 45 minutes to like an hour and a half depends on the store but this place is really popular tons of people were there picking up pizza so we're gonna try a slice and see how it is so we got the cold drink hot girl pizza they said it was one of their most popular ones it's pretty good we're off the bat get tons of that pepperoni and like it's super crunchy there's a crunchy top to the pepperoni you get some of that heat from the jalapenos it's pretty good the flavor is all right it's not bad flavor and the crust is done pretty nicely too so overall it's like a pretty it's a pretty dope pizza i don't know if it is my favorite though it's just a decently good pizza so it came with some of that dip i think this is something more spicy maybe it looks like a pretty creamy sauce like chipotle sauce look at cheesy maybe chipotle it's a really thick sauce but i kind of like the sauce how how would you rate it i i'd say it's like it's okay it's like a pretty decent pizza i wouldn't order it again though um i could see some other people liking this a lot just because of the toppings um and then the sauce with it but to me this isn't like my favorite pizza um i probably won't order this again honestly going in i didn't know what to expect from body though but because i saw it at like blue quartz activations were pretty low honestly um like this to me is like a franchise pizza this is like what was it 17 bucks yeah 17 bucks for this pizza for a 13 inch yeah for 13 inch for 13 a piece though and i i don't even think it's like significantly better than the domino's like the crust is definitely better than like a domino's or pizza pizza crust 100 dough is better ingredients may be slightly better so maybe like 13 pizza 14 pizza you know what goes really great with pizza some sports and we're going to open up a solid mba pack for you right now all right so we're going to do we're going to do an opening of the all-star game drop from top shot so got it today let's see what it is [Music] [Music] the next one we got is konzo's pizza and i think they gave us a rose is what they said it was um and like first right off the bat like we're looking at the pizza and you see there's like a giant like layer of oil on top i don't know how that is once we're gonna eat it and like the cheese smell is so pungent it's such a strong like strong smell to it let's see if we actually like this one bad huh you like the sauce folks we actually get a lot of the flavor from the parsley i think the cheese is really strong it does like the smell i think it's like a blend of cheeses it looks like there's like mozzarella maybe a bit of cheddar even and parmesan um but it tastes really nice it's just like a really strong and punier flavor from the the cheese uh decent flavor from like the parmesan i mean not the parmesan the parsley on top um and it's actually not as oily as i thought it'd be um it there's definitely still like a little like a layer of like oil on top um but it's not like the typeware is like dripping out like you know some of that cafeteria pizza yeah cafeteria pizza just like you could take a entire like roll of paper towel and try to soak it up and still be too much oil on top it supposed to be a rose sauce but i don't get any flavor of sauce in here i just get straight cheese maybe the cheese is just that strong all i get is like straight cheese from this so console's pizza is like like nick said it was like a lot of cheese and a lot of crust i like hardly get any tomato out of it even though it's a rose pizza um and the crust is kind of like kind of solid i don't really there's like not really much flavor coming out of the crust it's just like it's just kind of there it's all across that i would enjoy eating so this last one that we got eight mile detroit style pizza and i've also had another one another detroit style pizza thing was called defendants that one was really good so i have high expectations for this so but they only told us that their signature was the pepperoni so i mean i don't know how many places have a signature pepperoni pizza but right off the bat when you're like when you feel it when you touch it it's like really heavy and like super oily uh to the touch uh the cheese is like nice and stringy which i like um got that cheese pull and there's a lot a lot of uh pepperonis on top of this dude i felt like that mouthful of oil the cheese although it's like okay there's like a really thick layer of this cheese and it's not like the not the best quality of cheese either you know how like some cheese can be like almost plasticky it's kind of well the feeling i get from it and like the tomato sauce is like normal like very regular tomato sauce with basil in it it's detroit detroit pizzas like a deep dish type style pizza so like you would expect the crust the bottom around the around the pizza to be like kind of crunchy this is just like straight soggy because of the oil dude after i took a bite i felt like i just got like i just i felt like i just put on lip gloss as you can see some of the pepperonis are even burnt so that just like takes away from the pizza even more the crust has an okay crunch to it but overall this pizza doesn't do it for me the other place was way way better like way better i'll go to that place every single time over this one for sure all right so we finished eating all these pizzas and like our overall thoughts are all the same we all like queen margarita the best has the best crust has a lot of flavor it's nice and chewy it has a great sauce to it as well the mozzarella is nice and overall it's just such a great pizza for the second one uh we went blondies right so blondie's was pretty good it's very popular i want to try some of their other pizzas the one we got was just like it was pretty good but i didn't think it was on that tier that like demanded the same kind of popularity that we saw from the shop the third one was kondo's pizza um and honestly i didn't think i like really tasted any of the sauce in there it was just a ton of cheese and bread although like the layer of bread is really thin um overall the flavor of the pizza wasn't like the greatest i thought it was like pretty decent but i honestly wouldn't recommend it myself i wouldn't recommend you go there it's just like my opinion on that so the last one went to eight mile i would definitely not recommend it uh it was way too early i felt like unhealthy about the second as long like it was in my hands i already felt it was unhealthy um nothing about it was that great the sauce was like fairly mediocre same with the same with the cheese and that pepperoni some of them being burnt leaves a bad taste in your mouth i would definitely not recommend this place but overall i would highly recommend that you get queen margherita pizza it's probably like one of the best margarita pizzas in the city i've had eight different i think eight different or like six different margarita pizzas around the city and this one is definitely one of the best uh this and giluetta are like the best margarita pizzas and overall pizzas in general um but if you enjoyed the video leave a like and if you want to see more food adventures so that you know where to put your hard-earned money to subscribe to the channel i'd really appreciate it so until the next adventure peace [Music] you",

    "description": "We tried Planta Queen for today's food tour, a vegan Asian fusion restaurant in Downtown Toronto, Canada! We ordered their vegan sushi box and the queen classic which included a variety of Asian fusion food. It came with Dan Dan Noodles, Pineapple Fried Rice, Gyoza Dumplings, XO Tofu, Shanghai Slaw, Sorbet and a Coconut Dessert. How do all these stack up for someone who isn't vegan? or even vegeta",

    "transcript": "man not in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're going to plant a queen so my first video that i ever posted on youtube was planet yorkville go check that out if you haven't seen it i'll put it up in the description i think it's this corner um check that out first watch this one after so this one is they're completely different in terms of what they serve on their menus that one at yorkville serves more western food so you got like lasagnas you got pastas you got different salads this one is more like an asian fusion you got different types of sushi or mackie as well as like fried rice dumplings and things like that so i'm joined with ogpk boy and half of the hungry siblings and ogpk boy hates vegetables absolutely hates them so we're bringing him to a vegan place so he can see for himself that there actually is great vegetable great vegan food out there so today we ordered the queen classic so it comes with i guess a wide variety of different items on their menu that's like their signature dishes we also got the sushi platter and let's see how they [Music] are [Music] m i got these gills and dumplings i don't even know what's in them i think some like mushroom and some other vegetables i think there's carrot in it it's pretty good like the crust is all right it's not as crunchy as i thought it'd be but it's very fragrant inside i'm not sure what the fragrance is from though yeah i think it's like a combination of like different vegetables so i think like i i guess some like carrot taste out of it and like a bit of the mushroom but it's actually it's a pretty decent dumpling it's like it's not bad it's pretty good i think the dumplings need it to be a little more fried like the gyoza dumplings would have been nicer it feels a little more fried on the outside um the filling was actually all right it's pretty good um i do kind of wish it was meat though but i guess we are eating vegan food so you can't put that inside overall i think we all agree that um it would have been nicer with meat inside and the vegan version is not as great as like if you were to put some meat in it all right so the next one we got the slaw and it honestly does like when you first open it doesn't look very appealing it comes with a sauce and we just pour it all over it um you got like what some cabbage um a little bit of basil some coriander some onion i'm gonna get like the most sauced up the most sauced up point in this and uh let's see how this tastes it's like a strong whip of coriander holy crap like a licorice flavor there's something shredded in here as well that has like very strong licorice taste so it tastes like licorice and coriander oh and honestly that's not a great combination for me i don't think it is a great artist unfortunately it's kind of like it's like a spicy salad because of that because of that uh licorice taste it's almost like a floral taste to it i think it's like if you mix floral uh licorice coriander all together and create a salad this is kind of what it is really not flavors that i particularly like so i to me not a great salad yeah on to the next one next one we got is the xo tofu exo fried tofu so it's like an exo sauce um if you're asian you probably know what this is but um it gives a very like sweet savory flavor to it um and then it's right on top of that fried dumpling or no fried tofu sorry fried tofu it's really fragrant outside the box though like once you open it you get a whiff of that exo exo sauce pretty nice tastes good totally nice and soft it's fried nicely it's not too heavy of a batter and then you got like the actual sauce that like adds that kick of flavor and that's really where like most of the flavor custom is from the exo sauce and the rest is just like kind of texture but it's a really nice tofu and not much unlike regular like chinese dishes that you find that's a really strong exo flavor because they just kind of toss it right on top of that tofu whereas in some other places they mix it in with a sauce that has like a bit of vinegar in it and it like it won't be as strong of a punch it has a more balanced flavor this is like it kind of packs a punch with that exo sauce um because it's just like by itself right on top of that tofu i like it so far felix is a journey through uh yeah but like that's like universally bad for all of us yeah we got the noodles um comes with these egg noodles uh it comes with some cilantro on top as a sauce with these like i guess these like beans i'm not actually sure what they are um i'll try to find them in the description but yeah it comes with this sauce um so it's like egg noodles with kamut it says in the description um traditionally i think it's egg noodles with it's like a spicy and it's like a peanut based sauce um this doesn't smell like or seem like it has any peanut in it but we'll see what the first bite has a nice fragrant flavor to it it has slightly a nutty flavor to it but i'm not sure it's exactly peanut it might be a little bit like a small hint of it or like a sesame sauce in it and then this adds more like a i don't know if this like really adds much to it i don't know what kamut is this honestly reminds me a lot of like a bolognese sauce um where this this commute is creating like a thicker sauce with some texture to it almost similar to like what um in bolognese sauce like a meat would um but it has like that same kind of reminiscence of a donda noodle but not exactly we all just realized that this can't be an egg noodle or else that wouldn't be vegan right so i don't know exactly what it is it's reminiscent of an egg noodle um i don't think it tastes like has that fragrance of the egg but it's still it's not like a very great dish it tastes very good it's like not exactly what i would think a danda noodle is though um so it's like their own take on it i guess overall i think this looks more like a dundal noodle than it does actually tastes like one they put their own like kind of style and mix into it um and it tastes really great but to call it da da noodle i don't think it's like close enough to the traditional one to be called the dun dun noodle all right so next we got the pineapple fried rice it smells super fragrant you got some cashews in there some pineapple um and like it smells like it's been fried with like a lot of sesame oil too which adds like a ton of flavor and fragrance so let's take this first bite it's really nice it's like it's nicely fried and then like the pineapple gives it like a pop of like a juice of that juice so it's like not so dry of like a fried rice like some fried rices are like really super dry um when you add the pineapple in there adds that little bit of juice and then you just got some like cashews to add some like some crunch to it as well pretty solid fried rice i don't think anybody would be disappointed eating this we got the sushi box and try one of each this one's what i'm really like uh interested in because without like sushi mainly you put uh some type of fish or some type of like seafood on it but seeing as vegan can't have any of that so is the substitute really gonna taste the same or is the flavors gonna be there i guess we'll find out so let's take a first bite of this thing i have no idea what this is this looks like avocado with some cream sauce on top and then it's been like torched all right i think that's like cream cheese on top [ __ ] i hate cream cheese any type of sushi i swear to god i think that's cream cheese i'm not exactly sure i'm not hundred percent sure i know i don't like it and the rice is very like very just like mediocre it's like i don't think there's enough vinegar in there there's not really enough flavor coming out of the rice but holy that that like that cream cheese just masks everything i don't even taste avocado all i taste was cream cheese and with like a bit of rice nah man that in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible this next one has some like cashews on it has avocado maybe thin slices of tomato that looks similar to like a salmon and then the middle looks like that same vegetable that produces that licorice flavor um yeah i'll give it a bit liquor's flavor just something that like reminds me a little bit of like like a little bit of tuna that thing on the top i don't know what it is it's a little reminiscent of like the texture of tuna a little bit of the flavor but the combination of flavors to this one is actually not bad it's pretty good um does it do it for me like a tuna would definitely not you can't beat tuna but the flavor for this is actually pretty good it's not bad uh the next one is like a california roll with like avocado once again i feel like avocados and everything here um and then there's another thing that kind of looks like like a faux tuna i don't know i don't know what they use to make make that though i mainly just taste that spicy sauce not really a lot of anything else going on avocado is like a little bit creamy but um yeah it's just like like really creamy with like tiny bit of rice and all i taste is that sauce on top everyone says anything else so this compared to other types of like spicy salmon sushi or something that you at least get some of the texture out of that tuna or the salmon um i don't really get much out of that at all so this next one's this crispy rice thing and once again it looks like it has avocado um and that fake the faux tuna and some like rice krispies on top i don't know which one's all right i think out of all them i might like this one the best because it has different texture it's like it's not really sushi so it's like its own its own thing and then avocados creamy and then the faux tuna um tastes pretty nice it's not there's nothing like that blows my mind for any of these things but this is the this is probably like my favorite out of the bunch so for dessert they gave us a gelato it is a little melted now because we ate everything else and ate this last um i think it was strawberry gelato yeah strawberry gelato uh honestly you can't go wrong with gelato man just tastes good this just tastes like a standard gelato it also came with this other dessert it's sago with uh i think this mango some mango some grass jelly in it too it's like a sago dessert tastes pretty good it's like a it's a nice dessert it was like coconut tapioca with some it seems like mango some grass jelly this tastes really good i i love this type of dessert mangoes are nice and sweet too so we just wrapped up the meal we had so many different things so i'll just tell you what i didn't like and what i did like so i really didn't like that salad that slaw um i thought it was like way too floral in flavor it just didn't sit well with me in my mouth um that's definitely something i don't recommend getting um the sushi platter like for somebody that isn't vegan and i i love eating sushi and raw fish there's no replacement for it this didn't do it for me at all there's things a lot of things there that i didn't like uh that cream cheese type uh sushi the licorice slaw inside one of the sushis um i just felt like the overall balance of flavors really wasn't there whereas like in actual sushi i get that balance of flavors and i get like some really delicious delicious bite so i think my favorite from all the dishes were the daener noodles as well as the fried rice the pineapple fried rice those are both really great i would have them any time no doubt in my mind the desserts were also fantastic but i mean that's not really specific to like a vegan place just sago's really good in general uh sorbet is also very delicious so like there's no going wrong with either of those things the dumplings the gyoza dumplings i felt like i would have preferred having meat in them instead of the vegetable filling with carrots and mushrooms and then that tofu was very delicious as well it was kind of standard so like you could find something similar in a lot of other places but they did it very well i would order it again and i would eat it so let me know what you think about all the food that i tried if you've had it before too let me know if there's other vegan food places that i should check out and thanks for watching the video subscribe down below hit that like button as well and until next time peace ashley hates it he'll gag when he eats eggplant so out here",

This is a local business create by a great friend of ours, the sauce has a kick of heat, with a tangy touch and goes perfectly with oysters and wings!

    "transcript": "best i ever had what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're reviewing six heat birds eye chili um this is ogpk boy you might have noticed him in the last video i'll link that uh in the annotation box somewhere but we're gonna review this we have a whole wide array of food here we got some oysters from diana oyster bar we got some tiger shrimp jumbo tiger shrimp from tnt yeah yeah we also all-star wings just plain naked wings so we can get all the flavor from the sauce and some chicken nuggies because you just got it [Music] all right so first we're going to try it out with some of the shrimp just dip it in get all nice and all over the shrimp great do it cheers bro um what's wrong with the shirt you feel that shrimp huh that wasn't me that's probably you probably man just ate a bunch of stuff but there's like a kick a nice kick of heat and it almost reminds me of like buffalo flavored wings like buffalo flavor you know kind of yeah it was pretty well i've had this sauce before right but i've never had with seafood like a shrimp it's pretty good with the shrimp but i think that maybe it's better with some meat all right we're trying with some some of these chicken nuggets and dunk them dunk them all over the sauce i don't know how i like it with the with the chicken nuggets oh my god there's two hibiscus like runny yeah maybe a little too runny for for chicken nugget dipping sauce like these chicken nuggets you gotta really eat it with something sweet yeah they need something sweeter or like super salty like ketchup it's like most of the dipping sauces from mcdonald's is gonna be us on the sweeter side but this isn't really um sweet it has like a more there's like vinegar in it so it has like more of a i don't know more of a savory more of a savory tone to it than like a sweet one a little zest in it a little heat yeah it's like a little bit of acidity with the vinegar and then like i don't think that really goes well with the chicken nugget but it probably tastes bomb with those with those wings though hold on let's give it a try go for a drumstick bearing techniques for sure they're like perfect with chicken yeah nice you can have this as like the what number number two number three sauce on hot ones yeah calling you out hot ones try out the sauce put it on your channel this is good i definitely think this is much better than it being on both the shrimp and the chicken nuggets well i guess like that's most hot sauces just messed with chicken wing yeah so here we're going to try with some of these like these massive oysters when i first tried this sauce i tried it on its own and i felt like it was a mixture of like almost like a seafood sauce with spice but obviously after we're eating this it doesn't really taste like that it's more zesty so i don't know how it's actually going to be with these oysters i thought initially it might be great with oysters but let's try it out let's try it whenever you're ready bro cheers naturally when you eat oysters a lot of people already put vinegar they put like some lemon juice in it so like you get that zest and then you also add like hot sauce to oysters sometimes so this is like a perfect mixture it has some of that heat has a bit of vinegar has that zest so it's like a combination of all the flavors that you normally would put on oyster yeah all packed into one so it actually tastes really good with oysters so this sauce one of our friends actually created it so full disclosure this is a product our friend created but we love it enough to promote it as well so we're not getting paid nothing no sponsorship nothing like that we just really like the sauce and it's one of our good friends so i think this is a fantastic sauce so when we were at a cottage he actually gave us samples to try yeah he had i think even before the cottage he had like 14 different samples of sauces he came over to my place and we just tested them all out and he did this with a couple groups so this one the bird eye was the one that rained supreme it's like the more on the spicier side but overall they kind of kicked it down a notch for the end result so it's it's it's a balance of there is a kick but it's also very good flavor very light and acidic and has strong like citrus flavors into it too yeah so after all that he came out with this final product and it actually tastes really great you can get the sauce if you're interested downtown at mcewens and wild and fresh on cane spadina so these two grocery stores do sell his sauce and you can also get this online on their own website so we'll link it down in the description box below you guys can check it out if you want to buy it i highly recommend you try it out it's actually a really good sauce if you want to compare this to like a tabasco like tabasco's really plain it's very normal um i don't think it's that great of a hot sauce this is fantastic you put on a lot of different types of food like out of these four here we really liked it with both the oyster and the chicken wings not so much the shrimp or the nuggets but i mean every sauce is complemented uh compliments a different food really well and we think these two are the ones that were good so six heat just like its namesake comes from the six so the gta is a local business so if you want to support local i highly suggest you buy this hot sauce try it out for yourself um and drink you from the six right come on help support some hot sauce help support a small business man if you enjoyed the video what do you do felix smash that like button that's right you subscribe to the channel leave a comment down below is there anything else you want us to review just let me know in the comments and until next

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to the channel today i got a super exciting meal for you guys so we got an amex offer and they're giving us uh two full sets from toca a restaurant within the risk carlton for 85 and after looking at the prices on toka's actual menu this is an absolute steal so i'll put the prices up on the screen and you guys can look for yourself and see what the savings are like so we're going over to the risk carlton now to pick up the meal this is a special offer from amex for amex card holders only so we're gonna walk through the entire meal with you guys so you can see if it's worth for you to try toca and if you want you can also apply to get an amex card and get these type of deals as well so we just picked up the meal let's get eating so for the appetizer we have burrata it's butternut squash chutney with caramelized papitas uh arugula and grapefruit um and i guess it came with some crostini as well to like go along with it so here we got the crostini with the cheese on top as well as some of the pear it's so crunchy look crostini it's almost like a crouton that cheese is so creamy so so creamy that pear has some really nice like nice sweet flavor to it it really like blends together really nicely on its own it's actually really good too i think it's like buttered up maybe a bit of yeah i think they have a nice layer of butter on there so it's like super crunchy has that buttery texture that butter flavor as well by itself it tastes really great there's like a huge amount of cheese for the amount of crostini so you gotta eat some of it on its own as well the insides are nice and fluffy and there's a stretchiness almost like mozzarella on the outside of it tastes really really great so some of you may be wondering why a cheese dish with crostini is going to be mixed with some fruit it's because it's so creamy the cheese by itself and even just with the the crostini it's already buttered up so there's a lot of like richness coming from it so you need some type of use something to balance that out and that's where the sauce uh with the arugula as well as that fruit come in to really give it a type of balance so that your mouth isn't just like overflowed with richness i know before i said there might not be enough crostini for all the cheese but i forgot that they gave us two boxes of cristini's so maybe that is enough christine next we got the grilled atlantic salmon and it comes with a base that has some carrots it has mussels and lobster in it as well sauce here saffron butter sauce and it smells like it's infused with some some lobster in there as well it's so so fragrant like you smell it it's so delicious it makes you salivate like right away oh my god that's so good that skin is like grilled like so it's crispy it's nice and crispy it's really really delicious it has a really nice taste to it they season it so perfectly and the salmon is cooked so nicely it's very like nice and flaky it's this this dish is like blowing me away it's really delicious and then some of that uh some of that base with the with the carrots and maybe some potato and the lobster dash will nice oh nice chunks of lobster in here oh my god there's a couple chunks in there under the under the salmon so soft so delicious like lobster you can't beat lobster it's so good found a nice little muscle here soaked up all the flavor oh so good so good this dish is like very very good i would order this like 10 out of 10 times that i go here this is probably like one of the best dishes i've had on this channel so far so next we got the cornish hen with potato chickpeas broccolini and a romesco sauce um right off the bat when you open this up you smell like a huge whiff of like uh of seasoning so i think some type of like rosemary possibly um and like it's just such a delicious smell it smells so good um yeah it's just so good so let's first try some of that cornish hen did you see i even took pieces of breast first a really nice flavor to it seasoned well real nicely so that skin has a little top coat that's a little bit like crunchy to it very nice corner time we've got potatoes i feel like it's been nicely pan fried in some butter with some olive oil looks like there's a bit of basil on top of it like mixed in with it and some pepper as well a really nice flavor to that potato i love how they pan fried it nicely so that there's a slight crispy edge to it and then the middles are still super soft though got this broccolini that's also been uh it looks like it's also been grilled nice taste to it hasn't built like grow to the point where it's like super mushy it's still crunchy and you can hear that right off the bat once you bite into it um and it's nicely seasoned as well it has that same seasoning that i think the potatoes does so now i'm going to try some of that romesco sauce it's almost like like a curry paste you know almost a sense it has it has like it's a really grainy and like it's a really huge pop of flavor huge pop of flavor um but yeah it tastes like there's been mixed in with a lot of different spices to create that sauce and it really complements the the cornish hand very well so i just kind of looked up what a romesco sauce is and it's a combination of things like tomato garlic almonds pine nuts hazelnut olive oil and olives so i guess that's why it's it's like a thicker sauce and it's like noticeably thick like it's not as viscous and like liquid as some other sauces might be and i was completely wrong on that curry take um it just kind of reminded me of that but now knowing what the like the actual ingredients are i i can i can taste it a little bit more we got the lemon tart and it comes with a raspberry sorbet um almond crumble and a raspberry gel it looks so delicious they made it so beautiful and like that char on top they probably torched the the top of that i think it's like meringue on top um and then they they torched the top looks so pretty looks almost too good to eat but you know the flavor is probably just as amazing that crumbled the balance of flavors are so good like some lemon meringues or like lemon tarts like this are way too sour because of so much lemon in it this has a nice like subtle sourness to it but that meringue is so good and just balances all out this is really really delicious unreal really really delicious this raspberry sorbet really really good good the raspberry sorbet is nice uh refreshing um it has a really strong hint of that raspberry flavor which is delicious all in all this dessert is top notch right now i'm eating that top layer meringue on its own and it's it's like softer than a pillow it's just so light so light and fluffy it's unbelievable and get a shot for you guys here so once you put it through there's like a crunch right on the top and then it's so soft and fluffy in the middle it's crazy didn't know ram could be like this so good so good we just wrapped up the meal and let me tell you guys this has probably been the most enjoyable meal that i've had on this channel so far even better than enigma which like i'm sorry to say but i definitely think this place is better so when we picked it up it came in this bag and it's like sealed like those uh those bags that retain heat so that your food is kept either hot or cold depending on which one um even the sorbet they put in little containers with ice cubes inside of another container so that everything is kept to the right temperature um so walking through each of the dishes the appetizer was nice and creamy it was delicious the crostini was so crunchy and had so much flavor from the butter um it was such a nice way to start the meal the atlantic salmon was definitely my favorite and it was so delicious perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned and the smell of that sauce almost smelled like lobster bisque and as someone that absolutely loves lobster bisque that was perfect for me the cornish hen also has some nice flavors um it was grilled to perfection everything was delicious and potatoes i love potatoes that are made that way so that was top notch and that dessert was out of this world that that meringue on top of that lemon tart was insanely insanely fluffy it was like eating a cloud and the flavors were so nicely balanced and not too sour unlike a lot of other lemon tarts so this meal bang on hundred hundred percent do it again even if it's full price i really don't care it's that good you should try it out for yourself try it out at full price you won't regret it at all take that special someone on a nice date here risk carlton is absolutely beautiful so whatever you do i bet you are gonna enjoy that meal so thanks for watching the video leave a like if you enjoyed it and

    "title": "TIKTOK Viral Brunch Box Takeout from Light Café Toronto",
    "description": "Located in Toronto, Light Café's brunch box has been viral all over TikTok, they have a beautiful spread that's aesthetically pleasing and delicious to look at. The restaurant is a Taiwanese inspired Café but I don't really see the influence in the majority of their offering. The box includes various amount of brunch favorites including a croissant, mini pancakes, smoked salmon, waffles fries, egg",

    "transcript": "what's going on today we're going to like cafe to get their brunch box it's been viral all over tik tok we're going to review the entire thing and let you know if it's worth it [Music] so we got back i thought i'd do something more casual today and we're just going to eat straight out of the trunk so we're going to tailgate this and we're going to get on with the review so looking at everything it's a really beautiful display it's really nice looking box i see why everyone's posting on tiktok and instagram it's just very aesthetically pleasing so if you had this boxer for you right now leave in a comment down below what would you start with first i think i'm gonna go with the waffle fries um looks pretty good has a nice crunch to it not too crunchy and you can still taste the potatoes because it's slightly nice and fluffy on the inside these waffle fries are actually pretty good but they don't compare anything close to chicas if you've been to chicas downtown their waffle fries are some of the best i've ever had and honestly they could be some of the best in the entire world you never know next i think i'm gonna go with that croissant it looks nice and fluffy it looks flaky um it looks pretty good actually you see all those layers on the inside that means it's nice and fluffy it's probably going to be delicious to eat it's so nice and flaky it has a nice like buttery outside to it really soft on the inside it's really nice to crumble like crazy so back in my trunk's gonna be filled with some croissant but it's pretty good croissant actually i think they might have cooked it a little too long i can almost taste like a slight little bit of like burnt on it but it's not bad honestly it's pretty good so you get a lot of different choices of what kind of eggs you want i went with the eggs benedict you can get like scrambled you can get sunny-side up whatever you want so i'm gonna try to get you a shot of that runny oak when i first cut into it come here come close well that was a little disappointing uh so when you get like a post egg with some holiday sauce for eggs benedict it's supposed to be runny like really runny so once you cut into it it's supposed to ooze on now it looks really really delicious but unfortunately this one's like almost cooked all the way through which is like very very disappointing that's like that's not the proper way to cook like a poached egg with some hollandaise sauce although the egg was a little disappointing let's see how it tastes though it's not bad the holiday sauce could use a bit more sweetness to it i feel like it's a little a little on the blander side but the egg is tastes pretty good like the at the outside the egg white tastes good um i just wish it were runny man that's all i asked for when i when i order it eggs benedict come on as you can see when you dig to the bottom of that egg there's actually a little bit a little bit of runny yolk i wish there was much more though that would make for much better egg next it looks like we got some breakfast sausage in here as well honestly very standard um same ones you would find out like a hotel breakfast or like very standard stuff like it's nothing special just tastes like a normal sausage i wish they would would have done something like better i wish they had done something like homemade this is not that great we also got some nicely fried up bacon so honestly bacon you just can't go wrong no matter like what kind of bacon you got as long as pork bacon don't don't give me none of that turkey bacon you know but as long as you got this this is always good you can't ever go wrong there's nothing wrong you can do with it you just fry it up and you eat it tastes like basically tastes a little smoky nice and fatty exactly what bacon is everything you love about bacon so when you're ordering the meal you got an option of all these different types of meat so you get like when you have lobster you have smoked salmon you can get i think pulled pork and like a vegetarian option so i went on with the smoked salmon i love smoked salmon so let me tell you a little story when i was back in university it was my study snack i had that frozen uh smoked salmon on my on my desk with some crackers put them together and then got a nice snack for studying that's how much i love smoked salmon [Music] nice smoky flavor texture of the salmon it's so nice it's like the perfect balance of uh raw salmon and cooked salmon and has such a nice smoky flavor to it but honestly this one doesn't taste much different from the frozen salmon that you get at your local go supermarket loblaws or something grab that frozen salmon defrost it you got yourself pretty much the same thing so one thing you've got to do and i'm going to do it right now for you uh you got to get that croissant you got to put some of that salmon onto some of that egg put it all together and have it in one full bite because honestly that is a great amazing combination right here right here so bad that's how you properly eat this combination of food together put all together like a sandwich and you just dig in they put in a garden salad as well so you got these nice green leaves decently fresh um honestly there's not much wrong can go with doing like a garden salad it's just pretty simple it's pretty plain and honestly it feels like a space filler i guess the salad is kind of there just to balance everything else off so that you're not just eating a lot of heavy fattening stuff like hangover food like hangover oily fat food you're not having just all of that you got a little bit of salad there just to make you feel like you're a little healthier so the last and most exciting part are these mini pancakes they look really nice and fluffy got some syrup with it as well to look really nice has a really good flavor on its own even without the syrup it has a good flavor to it and it's nice and soft in the middle actually really good i really like this actually i've been out of all the things here this is the thing that i like most and you can order the entire you can order the same box with just way more of these pancakes too i think that's one of the options you should definitely do that one pancakes also came with a couple of berries nice and sweet some nice fresh fruit really goes well with the entire meal it's like cafe supposed to be a taiwanese inspired cafe but nothing about the maine to me screams out that it's been inspired by taiwan at all honestly they sell like pasta salads and these brunch boxes and nothing really taiwanese about them uh the only thing on their menu that seems taiwanese is their drinks like there might be some like bubble tea kind of flavors and uh like smoothies and stuff like that um so it's a little confusing you know so what are my thoughts on the entire brunch box i really wish that they actually did the egg properly um that would have made the meal a little bit better i wish that does something other than that regular like garden salad very normal very regular a lot of places do it nobody actually most places don't actually do it right or like do it nicely they just kind of throw a salad together and just like toss it there um honestly it's like a forgettable thing on in the entire box it's nothing you don't even need it there like you could put something else there and make it better uh instead of having this random salad you know yeah i think it's very average so there's nothing that really stands out to be like oh yeah this is a great place you gotta try this brunch place out um the pancakes were really great and i think i would get those again the rest of the box was like just you know average and i can't say that i would recommend it over any other like breakfast place that's pretty good like if you talk about emojis temple or something like i can't recommend it over that um this is just very average and like it provides pretty decent value for like 20 bucks you get quite a bit of food um and it's definitely better than getting like a 16 uh avocado toast but will i return to get this again uh maybe maybe i get i come back to get the pancakes again but that's about it to me this meal is like a one and done and like not particularly in a good way so like a good one and done is like zion goes to college for one year goes into the draft goes into the nba this is the bad one where like you enter the draft but you don't make it so like i wouldn't come here again most likely unless like somebody else that i know want to come here with me uh then i'll cope but aside from that i'm not gonna return just for this box um that's my recommendation to you you can check it out if you want to but honestly it's nothing that special it's just really hyped up with tech talk and instagram and all that so if you enjoyed the video let me know in the comments below leave a like on the video and follow me

    "description": "We visited COPS Coffee & Donuts to try their mini donuts and Cubby Smart Kitchen for their shrimp po boy and chicken souvlaki! The donuts probably surprised me the most, with their soft texture and delicious combination of flavors. Cubby on the other hand has been talked about a lot due to their covid friendly process to get food. You order from a kiosk, and get your food from a window but I just ",

    "videoId": "OFWtV80-z1E",
    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're going to two different places so first for the entree we're going to cubby's smart kitchen so this place has like a very modern style to it uh you order from a tablet or like a kiosk on the wall and they have four different styles of food all made in the same kitchen so they got like poke they got i think afghan or middle eastern food they got some burgers and they got uh seafood like po boys so we're going to go there and check it out then we're going to for dessert we're going to cops coffee and donuts and they're really popular right now on tick tock we're gonna try out some of their flavors and see what's good oh so first we got the souvlaki chicken souvlaki it comes with fries rice and obviously the chicken and then they gave us this souvlaki sauce and we're gonna toss a bunch of that in like right now and then mix it all up it smells really good right out right out the gate it smells really really good what i just eat i have no idea what i just put on my mouth but that tastes like an eggplant it was eggplanted there i was expecting it to be chicken so having eggplant is kind of weird now for an actual piece of chicken pretty nice flavor and there's a little it's a little tough and dry though almost like they might have overcooked it a little bit um it's definitely not the best soup okay flavor didn't cook that chicken the best way either no okay dish i guess with the fries it's like a soft cut fry so like you can obviously hear that you don't hear anything when i bite this fry not really much of a crunch to it um the fries taste pretty good they're like nicely seasoned and it tastes like potato next we got this salad that came with the soufflocky it has you can see like there's feta there's some olives some peppers tomatoes cucumbers and it came with this sauce i think it was like a mixture of like olive oil and maybe it's like a vinaigrette maybe so let's see how this one tastes pretty like normal standard salad so really you just got like the raw ingredients and you just kind of put it all together and then you have the sauce that's with it so really any type of flavor that you're getting aside from the natural flavor of like the ingredients it's just that sauce so nothing like really special about the salad it's just like literally anyone can make the salad you just have to find the ingredients bring them home and toss them together you have the same salad so i don't know nothing too special to me so the flavor really comes out from the feta and the sauce mixed together uh that last bite really gets some feta in it so now that i got the feta in a big bite that is really nice with that sauce but the rest of the stuff yeah like honestly you could find some feta at the supermarket same with the sauce mix all together you got the same salad so really you could do this yourself fairly easily one thing i'll say and give them prosper is while i'm eating the salad you can hear that there's a nice like healthy crunch to everything so meaning that it's probably a fresher ingredient so they say they locally they get everything local so like unlike a subway or something where every like piece of vegetable is really sad and limpy this still has a nice crunch to everything so like the ingredients are still quite fresh so next we've got this po boy it's a shrimp po boy um inside i could see that there's um some pickles i think it is um it's covered in some sauce it's like grilled shrimp and then you got the bun and the bottom looks like it's been toasted a little bit i can see like um marks from a grill um but it's not like evenly toasted the marks are kind of like if you can see that it's just like on the bottom and the tops kind of like missing almost the top has those same like grill marks on it so they they put this on the grill for a short while i guess um the shrimp actually has a nice barbecue flavor to it slightly spicy as well when i don't care from this or i think it might have been jalapenos and not like not pickles you got some lettuce in there as well i would say overall knowing this is supposed to be a po-boy i don't think there's enough like toppings inside of it usually po-boys are like filled to the brim you get like this massive sandwich just doesn't like it's not as filled like right now like looking at the sandwich for the pull bar they have like four shrimp in there for this long hot dog bud i don't think that's nearly enough shrimp to be in one hot dog bun um especially when they're not particularly large shrimp either overall i'd say the flavor of the pogba is actually pretty decent i wish it was just filled with more stuff um and maybe the bun toasted a little better or put on the grill for a little longer it has the grill marks but um i don't think there's enough like flavor coming out of the bun but first when we opened up the po boy it looks so sad because some of the shrimp kind of fell out um and some of the ingredients just came out of the came out of the sandwich so it looked kind of sad we put it back in pretty like decent sandwich um just wish there were more toppings it's also eating there's some person driving around in a car pulling their ferret out the window i'm a little a little frightened to be honest with you look do you see it right i thought it was a cat so for dessert we got cops and cops coffee and donuts uh this place is very popular right now it's all over tick tock it's like the line was not that bad it was pretty decent but the wait time pretty nuts so we were there and they said 45 minutes when we got back other people were lining up that was will be an hour away so just like know that in advance you might be better off just ordering off their app or their website and then just like waiting that 30 40 minutes and then picking it up afterwards going there first lining up is not the most efficient way to get your donuts it's got these mini donuts right here um i don't know what flavor they are we kind of ordered two flavors i feel like they just gave us the one or or is it two combined to one they combined the two flavors together so we ordered the weekly special which was french toast and i think it it's mixed in with another flavor and that's the cinnamon icing or cinnamon sugar i'll find out the actual one and then we'll put it in the description somewhere hmm secret flavor actually the donuts have are kind of soft inside they're soft overall and the dough itself is very like has a nice chew to it um you know when like a donut gets dry or like it's been cooked too much it's like really hard it's not like that at all it's nice and soft and then you get like uh some of that flavor from that that cinnamon oh that really like is a really nice flavor that cinnamon mixed in with that uh the sugar glaze um i'm not sure where the french toast comes in but like overall it's like it's pretty good actually i think it's i don't know it's worth the wait it's kind of worth the hype um because it is a really good donut i think if you were to compare this to tiny toms this would be the better one i think this really reminds me of eating cinnamon toast crunch like the cereal really reminds me of that but with a donut obviously we just wrapped up the meal so what are my thoughts on both of these places so first cubbies that chicken souvlaki was only very mediocre like i think i almost prefer mr greek to it and that's not a very high bar so i don't think i would order that again the salad was nice and fresh but i think it lacked like it does it's nothing special about it but the chicken itself kind of dry not a ton of flavor and then the rice was kind of bland so overall it's not like the greatest dish you can have then you got the po boy which honestly right off the bat it looked kind of sad and only came with four shrimp not a lot else going on there um although the flavor of the shrimp was pretty decent i wish there was like way more ingredients it needed much more if i actually just took four bites because of those four shrimp i would have like one third of that bun still left over and i don't know what to do with the one third of the bun overall cubbies i think is like cafeteria or like food co-quality food but they have like their own storefront and it's like a little like it's about the same price maybe a little more expensive than like a food court food um but then you have to actually wait much longer for your food so i don't know really where their value prop is aside from the fact you go to one storefront and you can get like four different styles but they're kind of like uh jack of all trades but master of none so honestly i can't recommend this to anybody i don't think it's worth going to um and i definitely definitely will not be returning then you got cops coffee and donuts that was actually pretty good i like that more than tiny toms it was a nice soft donut the flavor was really good and really reminded me of that like cinnamon toast crunch it was a delicious flavor i would get that again although next time i go i'm definitely ordering ahead of time like an hour ahead of time and then pick it up afterwards and honestly if it gets a little cold it's a donut it doesn't really matter it's still gonna taste great so if you enjoyed this video please leave a like it really helps out subscribe to the channel for lots more every thursday at 4 00 p m eastern time you're gonna get a new video on some delicious food so stay tuned and until next time peace [Music]",

    "description": "Korean BBQ is something I dearly miss so we tried a BOGO Deal for Korean BBQ Takeout in Toronto! We got pork butt & k-marinated top blade and a wide variety of banchan (korean side dishes) as well as leafs to make a ssam (wrap). We ordered from Cheongdam Korean BBQ, a new joint that opened up fairly recently that even sell some in house dry aged meats!",

    "transcript": "welcome back welcome back to what to phil's food review wait wrong language everyone so we got a special dinner meal for you guys here uh we went to chengdu korean barbecue and we got pork butt some some pork butt and some short rib and it's a take home korean bbq so they've already grilled up the meat uh for us they gave us all of the banchan the uh the samjong and the lettuce and i don't know what this leaf is but you see it all over in korea uh to make some some and let's just dig in so i think chengdu is a new place that opened up recently and they when we went inside i could see it on the wall they have their own dry asian lockers so they have different types of meat that they're dry aging in there that's probably something special that you could get if you wanted to uh we didn't go with that option today because they have a special going on right now for takeout and that's buy one get one free so you know can't pass that up that's a lot of food for like the same price that you would normally have to pay like double for so we went with that and we're going to eat all this and review each thing for you start with the meat all right i'm going to go opposite bok choy you don't eat vegetables man stop fooling everyone stop pretending all right first we got short rib let's see how how well they cook this it's decently soft there's not a whole lot of flavor coming to it i expected there to be uh a little more like saucy almost because generally speaking when you go to like a korean barbecue place you get short ribs yeah it's like marinade and certain sauce and this is this was called the marinade short rib yeah so i was expecting a little more marinade um this has a really light taste to it and it definitely tastes like um it's it hasn't been like overclocked it's been cooked like this like relatively nicely visually it doesn't look the best because obviously it's already been grilled and we had to take it home and like you know after a certain amount of time it's not the best let's try some of that pork butt got a big fish nice similar to the to the beef where there's some flavor but not like very pungent um i don't think i don't think there's enough flavor with it um but obviously with korean bbq you you like eat it with a bunch of different sauces you have uh different side dishes that go along with it you make wraps with it so like there's a lot of stuff that you can do to add flavor but i just wish that the meat itself had like a really great favorite to begin with and then all these things just complement on top of that giving credit that the the meat is soft and it's not overly done or undercooked or anything it's pretty good let's get on with it what else do we have here we got some bok choy um i like that it's like nice and spicy yeah what did you get that face for is like two sours on me no there's a spice to it this is bok choy that's what i meant to face this guy hates vegetables so if you see him making any face when you're eating any of a vegetable ignore it he's like the exception to the rule where he just absolutely hates it any type of vegetable he eats he's just not gonna like so uh can't really take his word for vegetables but it has a great flavor they've mixed in some spices it's like a cold dish you know yeah like it's not like they fried it up in a pan or anything it's like a cold dish and they just mix it with a bunch of spices this is something you would chew on just to like refresh a palette kind of thing this corn looks really good it's been like seasoned with um i think some chili powder these are like packed bigger or something too there's not a fresh coin at all it's just going stale isn't it yeah the flavor is a little weird to me too it's candy yeah it's really sweet but like now let me have fresh corn there's like a burst of juice it's like there's like no juice there's no just like just eating the corn kind of like dried out i don't know if this was done on purpose or just like but i don't particularly like that it is very sweet like i thought it'd be a little more spices to it but it's a very sweet glaze yeah the the corn it's like a candies isn't it i'm gonna go for meat again but we're gonna dip it in some sauce they give us some some sauce here and it's like a mixture of salt and sesame oil so maybe this will add some acid flavor to this meat it definitely adds some fragrance sesame oil has really strong flavors to it so it adds a nice fragrance to it try some of this kimchi i'm curious how this kimchi is i'm not a fan of it like most kimchi actually um i like your kimchi's are fresher and spicier i mean the only good kimchi's ever had was in korea so yeah that's true this is not bad it's uh there's no strong sourness to it because it's been pickled and then you've got the spice coming out as well so like the spice is actually more spicy than i think most other kimchi is that you usually find in in like canada or toronto but this one's actually pretty good i actually like this one what do you think i don't find it that sour actually i've had waste our more sour kimchi than this but it is definitely a more on the spicy side compared to the average korean restaurants you find here um it's nice though it's nice and refreshing it's it's not like too spicy or too sour it's good all right so the next thing we have to do is create a sound so when you're eating korean barbecue you are served with a bunch of lettuce or this other vegetable i'm actually not sure what this is leave it in the comments section below if you know what it is let me know but grab this um you put in your meat you put in whatever side dishes you want uh and then you put some samjhan and it's gonna taste completely different it completely changes up the flavor profiles just like all that mixed together so i'm gonna put short rib um this spicy green onion salad some of these onions i think they came with a sauce i don't know what's in the sauce it's like a vinegar kind of sauce just like a vinaigrette kind of almost uh some samjong so then you got this i got my son some to eat cheers i think that almost adds like a liquor flavor do a liquid flavor to this dude not fat licorice it's probably not for you this is not for me liquidation is okay you're not a huge fan though the rest of the flavors are good the beef is nice and tender got some spice from that green onion salad and you got some of the crunch from the onions and samjong always adds a ton of flavor samsung is always so good the best if you don't know what song changes it's like um soybean paste that's right soybean paste there's two containers here one has some some sauce the spicy sauce mixed with some garlic the other side just has like peppers and garlic um you can mix it all up to eat together i'm gonna do lettuce this time do with the pork i forgot last time to put it in the sesame oil dressing some of that spicy it's actually quite spicy this uh green onion salad yes it's a nice kick to it i don't know what should add some box for you know why not add some kimchi too everything all in one bite oh this might be a giant mouthful let's make a salad like to say that's what she said that's what she said [Laughter] great flavor i think this is where the beauty of korean barbecue kicks in when you combine all the flavors from the wrap the meat the the bunch on this samjong you combine all the flavors from all these different little elements and it's like a mouthful of so many different flavors that all work together and it really pops so you've never had cream barbecue before this is the this is like the way you do it and honestly some of the best barbecue right unique um flavor profile itself like nothing quite like this yeah nothing quite like a korean bbq um and it's very like communal so obviously we're here we're just like presenting you this uh this meal that we got but usually when you're doing korean barbecue you're sitting together with your friends in like like either a square table a round table and the grill's right in the middle and all of you have like raw meat just grilling it and eating it having a good time drinking some soju drinking some some beers um and it's like a really good time you're just all in like this this huddle just cooking and eating together um unfortunately we can't do that cause korea but this is a nice alternative let me try this out this wrap with pickled radish i've digested some some green onions oh let's get spicy garlic in there you're always talking not to play with your food but this is literally playing with your food hey this is proper playing with your food i'm assembling i'm assembling a nice wrap for myself nothing wrong with this there is nothing wrong with this this is the proper playing with your food when you're taught as a kid what is your fusion of uh i think that pickled radish kind of cuts through the liquid flavor a little bit to mix into the other and it doesn't it makes the licorice flavor not strong so if you don't really like legumes but you can add it with some fermented radish or whatever else that you got i think it tastes pretty good i like that oh man that's a mouthful good luck you know what they say i was trying to say about yourself there's happiness in my mouth that's for my son you're making me out of yourself we're both pretty much full and we're pretty much done the meal so let's summarize everything for you guys so all right felix first let's hear from you what did you think of everything i mean nothing really stood out to me it's a pretty mediocre korean barbecue place um uh there's one place that we usually go to and their prices are relatively similar and uh comparing the two the meat quality is definitely way better there and just based on that with the main dish of every korean barbecue being the meat we feel that this place needs to step up the game yeah so i'll just add a little bit on to that so generally speaking i feel like the meat over there was a lot better but we're looking at the side dishes um we really didn't like this corn like the koreans watching this video please let me know is this a normal thing in korean barbecue cause i've never seen it um it's something completely new to me and neither of us liked it like whatsoever i don't know why it's here we're used to having that cheese corn for korean bbq yeah cheese corn is a definite must obviously we can't have it with takeout i don't know if what they'll do when it becomes like in in-store dining but like the rest of these um let's talk about like the rest of these side dishes so i felt like all of them were actually pretty good green onion salad i felt like was that was really good it reminded me of something i had in like la um the bok choy salad that was pretty good too yeah with that kick it was definitely yeah it was definitely a nice spicy kick to it um i felt like this onion these onions mixed with a sauce it could have been more sauce they didn't like give us a whole lot um generally when we went to our favorite place to go to always is um i'll link both of these in this description box below but they give you like this bowl of onions with a sauce in it and when you dip the meat in there or like you get some of that onion it sucks up it sucks up all the flavors and it adds so much it adds like it's like vinegary it's kind of sweet it adds so much to the meal when you have that um and i felt like that missing a bit of that sauce but it's hard for me to give you guys like a full assessment of the meat because obviously they cooked it ahead of time um took us maybe like 20 minutes to get back here and filming and all that stuff so like i don't want to say that it's 100 100 percent worse than a and like i don't ever want to return i would like to try it once in the store to see what the experience is like if it's different from this but so far like as a takeout dish i'm not really excited about this i was looking forward to a much better quality korean barbecue when i saw this unfortunately this didn't meet my expectations um maybe it korean bbq should just be left for in-store dining maybe that's the thing maybe once i go in person it's gonna be great but we'll find out when that happens but until then you guys can leave in the comment section below what's your favorite korean barbecue place and like the video subscribe to the channel for lots more food reviews because i'm going to give you the truth i'm not going to hold anything back you guys hear the honest honest truth out of me so until next time peace you",

    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to the channel today we're going to bing's it's a very popular fast food joint from beijing it just landed here in toronto uh we're going there right now we're gonna pick up a few items from their menu and share it all with you and see if you should go there yourself to try it out let's go so in front of me we got a whole selection from bing's this place is like one of the top most popular uh fast food joints in beijing it was started by two guys that used to work in it for like baidu and tencent and they wanted to create something give traditional chinese flavors and their main item is this burger and it has this like really crispy um crispy and flaky bread on the outside with a ton of filling on the inside and that's like their signature item at the at the fast food joint so when we went there's different combos to choose from we caught two different combos and it comes with all of these things so you got pop you got we got black pepper black pepper beef with mushroom their signature burger with pork butt and here we got a wonton soup we got some fries with a mixture of different chinese spices these are a shake shake fries so they give you the fries in a bag with all spices in a little cup and you just toss it into the bag you shake them all up and it creates this delicious uh delicious bowl of fries so lastly we got this noodle with sliced cucumbers and tofu it comes with this spicy sauce so it's like a chili oil based and everything here looks delicious let's try it out let's review it so we'll start with the burgers first so we'll go with their absolute best one i guess their signature their signature pork butt oh once you once you pick this up you can tell that the the breading on the outside super flaky and it looks it's really crunchy too like you see that that nice coloring on the outside that it's been nicely baked it's so flaky the pork has a really nice flavor it's nice and tender and it's really light actually it's not very heavy it's not like super oily and like substantial i can almost imagine myself eating this as a snack the bread on the outside is so nice and crispy it's flaky it's delicious really has some great great flavor all right so next we got the black pepper beef i'm actually really excited for this it looks like it's going to be really flavorful looks like it's been nicely seasoned outside still looks amazing so flaky as hell i feel like crunch oh my god i've done such a good job keeping it nice and flaky and nicely cooked nice like toasted outside and right as you bite into it you immediately pick up that black pepper flavor it's nice and strong um there's a deep like rich very savory flavor to it the beef is nice and like it's not chewy it's very nice and soft i got some of that mushroom in there too i have a little bit of different texture and the flavor gets soaked up by those mushrooms and as you're biting the flavor just releases and it's such a nice flavorful black pepper sauce to this out of the two sandwiches or two burgers i actually really like this one this one is my favorite over the signature the signature is like it's really nicely done but it doesn't have as strong of a flavor and i was looking for something i like a little bit stronger flavors so the black pepper actually worked well with my palette nice refreshing coke one thing i gotta say is that the outside is when you're holding it with your hands it gets kind of oily but when you're eating it you don't actually feel it it's just really nice and toasted up and as a full meal you can eat this and it wouldn't feel too too much oil or too much it wouldn't feel too heavy or too hefty it's a really nice meal and it's nice and light with some really good flavors so now you can't go with the burger without having the fries so i'm gonna try some of these fries out mmm the seasoning is so nice it's like a sichuan spicy like dry spice kind of flavors and there's a real kick to it so if you're like not that great with spicy like this might be a little too spicy for you like i can feel it it's tingling my tongue but the fight the flavors and the spices along with like the chilies adds so much flavor and it's like a really nice flavor this honestly reminds me of like if i go into a sichuan place and i got like a hot pot like that kind of spice it's really nice flavors and like it's not just heat there's a sweetness to the flavor there's like maybe a bit of cumin coming out of there as well and i love those flavors these fries taste awesome so the fries themselves here they remind me similar to like a costco fry so it's nice and like crunchy on the outside but also nice and chewy on the inside it's nice and warming really nice flavor textures are great fries are cooked nicely overall really really great so now let's move on to the wonton this is just like it looks so nice and refreshing like a wonton soup it's got some seaweed in there some uh some sliced egg and there's this like red bean to it i don't know exactly what this is but i know it's very popular in some chinese soups and other dishes so now i'll taste the soup first [Music] has a nice refreshing flavor to it it's so nice it's really light in flavor but you get that like the saltiness of the seaweed and then you can just like pick some of it up as well to get that extra texture you got some of that egg mmm it's like nice and stringy get that fragrance from the egg now the main part the actual wontons [Music] got some meat in there yeah it might be like pork wontons and there's like a bit of herbs um i think some like green onion inside these tastes really really good and the soup complements the wonton perfectly like the flavors just melt together so well it's so nice and refreshing it's like really nice like tiny bite size wonton so you can honestly eat so many of these in one sitting especially with this soup like it's not gonna be super like heavy on you everything here is like nice and light which i really really like sometimes when you go for like fast food it gets really heavy just like sits right down in your stomach and then you feel like lethargic for the rest of the day this i feel like you can eat an entire meal and you're gonna still feel upbeat you can still have a lot of energy so lastly we got the liangpi noodles here and with the cucumber the nice uh the nice chili oil it's like a cold dish though to let you guys know it's not like supposedly supposed to be eaten hot it's a cold noodle so let's see what this flavor is like mmm nice and chewy it's nice and stringy and you get like that chili oil flavor which i really like i really love adding chili oil to my food so this is like the right type of flavor for me there's also a nice like almost like a plum sauce that comes with this so you have both of them together that plum sauce actually has a ton of flavor it's really really good like it adds a type of fragrance to it that just chili oil alone doesn't have and then you also get the spiciness of the chili oil i think the flavor combination here is really great the noodles though are not my favorite type of noodles they are quite nice but they're a little more stringy and maybe a little gelatin-y i don't know how to describe it but it's like a little chewier than most other noodles and not as like these don't taste like your traditional hand-pulled noodles it tastes slightly different but like overall the flavor is really great i feel like the texture just a little a little bit not up my alleyway but i can see a lot of people liking this still and then you have the tofu here that soaks up all of those flavors together they're really nice like add some like chewiness to the entire meal overall this noodle is really fantastic i love how the refreshingness of the cucumbers like you have some that spicy and you brighten some cucumbers and that juice just like comes out and it's like a really refreshing pop of flavor that mixes together really well the entire dish we're gonna finish off this food we just took little bites of everything here and honestly everything here i think is really fantastic this is almost like restaurant quality food that you could find at some other places but this is made into like a fast food joint so right now it's brand new in toronto it's super popular so the line was a little bit long i think we waited maybe like 45 minutes to get all our food but the flavors are really popping and you don't actually find this at many other places like these flavors

    "description": "We visited Big Beef Bowl 牛大碗, an authentic chinese hand pulled noodles, fried dumplings (sangji bao) and chili oil spicy beef and tripe. This restaurant is right outside Toronto in Markham and served up some of the best bowl of noodles in the entire Greater Toronto Area. The soup is filled with beef flavor, the braised beef is tender and falls apart as you bite it and the noodles are cooked perfec",

    "transcript": "so welcome back to the channel uh today we're going we went to the big beef bowl so this is one of my go-to spots for hand pulled noodles like chinese style so i got the braised beef with flat uh flat regular noodles so when you go to this place you have the option to choose whatever type of noodle style you like whether it be flat or round and then you can also choose a thickness so it can be really thin normal which is like what you would typically find at a restaurant or you can have it really thick if that's the style that you like but it lets you change that up so that you have different textures when you're eating and not just like every time you go there's the same noodle you get a different one every time if you want to if you have a go-to um you can do that too and just like hey you can kind of customize it to the way you like they have other flavors as well in terms of soup base and sort of toppings so you can explore the menu i'll link it down description below um and you can go check that out so first thing we're gonna try right now is that noodle um it looks really good like when you look at some of the pieces of the beef brisket falls apart no problem it's so tender so soft and carries so much flavor it's like a very savory um it almost tastes like uh five spice you know star in these you taste some of that in it has some of these radishes a nice light refreshing vegetable so first sip of that soup so much of that beef flavor i'm pretty confident it's a beef broth and it carries so much flavor in it i love drinking this soup but another thing you can do if you like make it spicier so they always give you chili oil we got that here i'll maybe add some later after i eat it a little bit i'll tell you how that tastes with it mixed in whenever you go to a noodles place like i feel like the most important things that you always gotta look for is a really good broth so this one's super tasty super flavorful filled with spices and herbs like there's a slight little bit of spice to this one um it's not like neutral so if you're one of those people that think pepper spicy this you might feel like this is spicy too but to me this is like this is like somebody just like crazy that's how soft the spice is to me but the flavors are delicious it's filled with that like the the beef flavor after being like like brewed for so long and boiled for so long so this is what regular flat noodles look like let's give it the first bite nice and chewy you can tell that it's actually really harmful and not done by a machine here you got like a little thicker so you got a little thinner so you can see that it's made freshly every single day at the restaurant they boil it in hot water and comes out nice and tender or like al dente i guess if you want to use an italian term but it comes out nicely ready to eat and it has such a nice um has a such nice texture to it and because they made it so nicely it goes really well with the soup so that flavor from the soup transfers onto the noodles and it's so delicious this is one of my favorite like beef brisket noodle places like hand pulled noodles i don't think this is necessarily like a taiwanese style noodle like you know there's a taiwanese beef brisket soup this is a different style i think it's more of a chinese like a mainland china style but this is really really great and i love the flavors coming out of this the beef brisket is so nice and tender it's like it falls right apart like look at that you stretch it a little bit comes right off if you think you're missing some of that vegetable it comes with some bok choy some delicious bok choy but whenever you go to one of these restaurants they always give you a bottle of chili oil or like this little container of chili oil at the restaurant they'll have it on the side on every single table so you can always have access to it and we're just gonna pop and put in some of that chili oil for me usually i just like picking out all the chilis out of it and spreading it around um i don't necessarily like adding the the oil but that's how they like get the aromas and the flavors out of the chili the chili peppers when's so powerful today just mix it up with all of that nice chili oil this is gonna have a completely different profile to it now so now when you're eating it you have that same strong beef flavor but the chili oil adds another layer of just that kikka flavor some heat so that after you take that sip of soup that heat lingers on your mouth it's very delicious flavor like because it's been fried up in that chill in that oil the flavors have just opened right up like all of those dried chilies or those like um chili seeds they've all just been opened up all the flavors have popped out and you get that like kick of flavor once you eat a bite with any of that chili oil in it also got some side dishes with this noodle so one of my favorites right here is this is slices of braised beef and tripe so they've all been like braised they've all been cooked really nicely and they become very tender and what they did is they mix it in with a ton a ton of chili oil so if you look like the bottom of this has so much like oil and chilies it looks really spicy they've been like soaking in this for a while now the flavors really integrated into there and i'm going to take a bite and i'll let you know if it's too spicy or if it's not so here first let's grab like a slice of beef such good flavors you may be so good i love the flavors coming out of this it's nice and spicy like and don't get me wrong it's not really hot if you can take like a mild hot sauce this is kind of how spicy it is and the the beautiful thing about this is like there is that spice but there's also tons and tons of flavor so you get like almost like a nuttiness out of it you get that nice flavor of beef coming through as well is not overpowering the beef at all it just complements it really really well and next we got the tripe i think tripe's the inner layer of the stomach and it's been cooked really nicely let's take a bite look at here it's like nice and chewy there's almost like a gelatin like um texture towards it and like if you've never had it this might be a little odd for you but it honestly to me tastes really really good you can find it in faux and like some other some other dishes as well but tripe has really nice texture to it it captures in a lot of that flavor and it has its own like juice profile so the flavors pop once you bite into it that gelatin releases some of that flavor and you get that mixed in again with that flavor of the chili oil that just adds like it really complements it well this generally comes as a cold dish on the side so whatever you're eating whether it be rice noodles whatever it might be this can go really nicely right on the side every time every couple bites of that noodle grab a grab a slice of beef some nice chili oil beef and like it's a delicious compliment to any type of meal any main that you have this is a tremendous compliment so good i also got this thing called sanjin bao so it's like a fried uh fried pork dumpling or fried pork bao if you want to call it that so let's get a fresh one here so it's nicely fried up on the bottom and because it's sealed up like this it's like almost steaming the meat inside so it releases all the juices out of the i think it's beef or pork that's inside of here so one thing before we start eating this uh you might have see i already started eating one but one of the things that you have to remember when you're eating something like this is be careful of not just grabbing it and taking a giant bite out of it really quickly it's filled with like really hot juices from the meat so that so if you actually take a giant bite you're gonna burn the hell out of your mouth and it's happened to me it's happened to some friends um and what's worse than that is sometimes you bite into it and a whole pop on the other side and splash all your friends so be careful don't do that one way to eat it show you now what a lot of people like to do actually is take a bite out of it like really tiny bite from the edge and then you can pour out all of that juice and then so that it doesn't splash around right you're gonna drink this it's like a soup oh really flavorful so good oh all the flavors from that meat is just all concentrated into that juice it's so delicious but now you have a very whoops now you have a nice a nice dumpling that won't splatter and won't burn the hell out of you either way just be careful when eating these things the meat inside retains so much juice because it's just captured all into this wrapping the bottom is nice and like a little bit crispy the tub has some like sesame seeds on it honestly the wrapping for this bow or dumpling it made very nicely it's like nice and thin on the top side and then the fried side's a little thicker obviously because you're trying to fry it up so it gets a little more cooked but they've made it into a perfect ratio where the bottom is nice and crispy but the insides are still nice and chewy while the meat is just all the flavors captured up and it's all captured right into this little package of joy and you get to bite into it and experience all of the flavors that come out of it it's just this is a treat if you have not got sanji about i don't know what the hell you've been doing go get yourself some try it because this is um overall what i think of this place you saw that i enjoyed every single item from this meal and this is honestly one of my go-to spots i come here all the time i bring friends and family i come here alone even on my days off and when i'm when i just really feel like some takeout just like today i came out here because i really enjoyed this meal i want to share it all with you um i'll leave everything in the description box below so you can check them out as well if you haven't already but please in the comments down below leave me some recommendations what do you think i should eat what would you like to see me review i know i got filipino food still on the list don't think i forgot that that's coming your way um hopefully soon i'll see if i can make the time for it anyway if you like the video please leave a like on it and subscribe to

    "description": "Named Best Fried Chicken in Canada by National Post and Best Fried Chicken in Toronto by BlogTO, PG Clucks is definitely a gem in the GTA. They take Halal Chicken from Sargent Farms, debone the leg meat, brine it for 24 hours in a lemon and herb, then put it in buttermilk for 6 hours and dredge it twice for extra crispness. They specialize in sandwiches and Nashville style Hot Chicken!",

    "transcript": "what's going on it's phil from phil's free review welcome back to the channel today we're going to one of my favorite chicken burger places in all in the entire city uh national post named this place best fried chicken in canada and blocktio says they're the best fried chicken in toronto so this place called pg clucks we put our order so let's go [Music] this is the jalapeno and honey spicy burger spicy chicken burger from pg klux uh first impressions when you look at it there's so many jalapenos i'm a little afraid it's gonna be really spicy um and the chicken looks really juicy it's like nicely fried up um the one thing like first off the bat when i look at it is the bun looks a little soggy on the top but let's take a first bite and see how it is you fried up that that chicken and it's so juicy look there's no other comparison to this they have some of the best fried chicken sandwiches you can ever find i don't know how they keep it so moist inside and have it fried on the outside still pretty crazy how good it is as i'm eating it it's actually not that spicy if you can take jalapenos you can take the spicy beverage of this for this burger it's really not that spicy you have like nothing to be afraid of if you can take jalapenos you're good some bite to this you really get that honey mixed in with that chicken so it's like um it's almost similar to that chicken and waffle vibe where you got that sweetness and then it goes well with like the fried uh the fried chicken it's a really nice combination i really love that um and they've done it so well here like this this burger is so solid it's like if you're talking about kfc popeyes chicken burgers they don't compare they're not even on the same level this is completely different this is top of the city best in the city um you're not really going to find anything much better than this at least i haven't so you really got to eat this burger and try it for yourself next we just got three pieces of their fried chicken there's one spicy at the end there um and two non-spicy uh these honestly don't look you're like your traditional fried chicken it's not like uh like bone-in like bone-in thigh or it's not like a drumstick this just this looks like the same patty that they're kind of using for their burgers but just by the chicken the chicken by itself so i'm gonna take a bite of bite of each one let you know how it is it's just as good as a burger it's so juicy and so moist inside that crust is nice and nice and crispy like you hear that crunch on every bite it tastes so good and here we got the spicy one it looks like they just they toss a bunch of uh like spicy powder uh like chili powder on top of it it's like covered in it let's hope this is not too spicy it's actually not that spicy it adds like that slight kick to the chili and that's that's kind of it it has like a decent flavor but i don't know i don't think the powder like this chili this chili powder adds um as much flavor as i thought it might but once again the chicken is so moist it's so delicious like you can't go wrong piece you want to get spicy non-spicy they're both going to be delicious and next we have the crinkle fries you can see how delicious those look look nice and delicious oh it's so crispy it's so nice it's nicely salted you don't even need anything to go with this eat these alone and they're delicious and there's not much better than this i thought i haven't had crinkle fries in a long time this reminds me of shake like shake shack fries but way better than shake shack fries chicken fries kind of dull actually last time i had it when i look at it more closely they actually have some seasoning on top of this as well i'm not sure what the seasoning is but it's it's really delicious so another side that we got with the with the chicken and the burger is this macaroni salad like a yeah it's macaroni salad actually there's nothing special it's not that great actually um it's kind of just like a mediocre macaroni salad yeah not great you're better off getting double crinkle fries instead of this so it also came with these sauces so i'm going to try with some some fries see what they're like this almost i was like a vinegary mustardy taste it's okay like i don't think this necessarily like makes the it doesn't necessarily complement the fries that well i don't know how it is on the chicken i think this one's just your classic ranch um yeah if you like ranch sauce this is a good one um you dip it with your fries your chicken it's classic ranch so we're gonna finish up the food and then when we come back i'll i'll share with you some of my thoughts on on pg clogs and all the food that we got today so how was pg clucks overall i would say the sandwich was bomb it was so juicy it's so flavorful and you're not going to find anything close to it in the city so chick-fil-a kfc popeyes nothing compares to it so you got to try that out as for the fried chicken pieces themselves they're similar to what the sandwich is i honestly prefer the sandwich myself if you were to go with just one thing go with one of their sandwiches as for the crinkle fries those are so good it seasoned perfectly you wouldn't need any additional condiments on the side or anything like that um they're top notch as for that macaroni salad that really isn't it i didn't like it and i don't think you should order it you should pay the extra two bucks get more critical fries you won't regret it overall i really think you should try pg clucks if you like the video smash that like button and subscribe it really helps with that youtube algorithm and leave me a comment below do you think there's a better fried chicken sandwich place in the entire gta thanks for watching see you next time [Music] you",

    "transcript": "what's going on it's phil from phil's food review um welcome back to the channel if you're new feel free to hit that subscribe button down below uh give me a like as well it really helps with that youtube algorithm so actually smash that like button alright so today i'm taking you to two restaurants because it's my valentine's day special i'm gonna have it with my girlfriend you guys are gonna come along with us so the first restaurant we're going to is minami it's a sushi restaurant downtown they got a fantastic sushi platter and we got that and second we're going to cafe balud it's in the four seasons they have an afternoon tea we're gonna get that set and show you what that's all about um and i hope you enjoyed and come along for the ride [Music] so first i'm going to try the tuna mackie looks like a healthy portion of tuna with the rice the proportions look like the proper proportions some place you go you get way too much rice for the amount of tuna this looks perfect let's dig in the tuna tastes nice there's not too much rice as i said before you really get that vinegar flavor out of the rice it's really nice all together this next one here is tuna belly and it looks like there's a little bit of green onion inside it same with the other one perfect proportions let's dig in um it's so rich and creamy the fattiness of that tuna belly is perfect in there and the ties give it that little bit of texture they need to cut through some of that fattiness it tastes so good i really haven't been to another place that does tuna belly mackie like this and but i gotta say it's really impressive it's really great so now we got the atlantic salmon nigiri looks like a really healthy portion of the salmon which i love that you see a little bit of color from the skin has a little couple cuts in it tastes super fresh it's really creamy compared to some of the other place you go to i think some of the layer on the top that color was a little bit of that fat and that gives it that little extra bit of texture and a little bit of richness that usually if you go to another place that gives you like cheap salmon it's just straight meat and it doesn't taste as great this is like buttery smooth when you eat it and you put it into your mouth and just tastes great this next piece has got to be one of my favorites that i like to order when i go to sushi restaurants it's called hamburg so i i have i'm looking really looking forward to this one once again really great but this one when you bite into it has a little more of a snap it's a little bit more um what's the word it's a little bit more solid not as soft as some of the other pieces i've had other hammer jacks before and this isn't as great like those high-end hammer jacks are really really delicious and like it's like melts in your mouth and it has a really great flavor this one's a little um tougher when you bite into it there's a little bit more of a snap this next one is the chutoro which is the medium fatty and this looks this looks really great you see like the marbling of um that fat with the meat nice and soft fine just add some richness into it really get that great flavor of the tuna it's really refreshing and you can tell that this is some pretty good quality tuna this next one is the otoro this is the fatty tuna so even more than the next than the last one it's more rich more fat you can really see like this has the perfect marbling it's one of my favorites i love eating this it's so rich it's so creamy if you're if you're not a fan like that fanny tuner you might not like this the best you might actually like tutorial better for me this is one of those pieces where you can only indulge in it so many so many pieces like maybe one or two if you keep going with it it's going to be way too much but just having that one piece it's great adds some really great flavor so next we got oshi which i think is torch sushi this one is the yellow tail it has it has like serrano pepper a little bit of like lemon juice on top uh let's try it has a nice flavor and it is amusing in there um the lemon adds that little bit of acidity to cut through like uh the some of the taste of the uh the yellow tail really good combination of flavors this next one is the salmon oshi it also has that pepper on top and uh like a creamy sauce on top of the salmon hmm that cream they put on top of the salmon they torch it really nicely you can taste that flavor of it being torched as almost like a charred barbecue flavor on top of it it's really nice this one is the tuna it has it's supposed to have a little bit of spicy sauce on top and some i think the capers on top it's really good it's not too spicy it's just like a little hint of that extra flavor the fried capers on top add a little extra texture on top of the tuna it's really nice all together and last but not least we have ebby which is prawn i think it's sweet prawn this is usually my favorite so let's see um you guys are crunchy when you bite into it you really get hit with a citrusy flavor it has lime juice on top of it so you really get that citrus flavor from that lime mixing with that with the sweetness of that shrimp it's really nice actually so we just finished eating it this was the minami sushi platter uh it's their valentine special so you get 28 28 pieces for 60 bucks i think it's a pretty good value um given that you're giving these nice pieces of fatty tuna you get something different like the uh the tuna belly maki as well as those four pieces of torch sushi it's a great combination i think it's a great meal to share with your loved one your significant other whoever um and valentine's being one of those crucial points in any restaurant like you've got to get it right or else you're ruining someone's valentine's and they're not going to come back to you if you do that so they did a great job doing with this uh making this platter it's a great value as well i think um does it compare to like an omakase i don't think you can go that far to say that it's the same level as an omakase just because omakase you get the chef's specialty they put a little more care and effort into the combination of flavors on each piece especially the nigiri they usually put something on top uh they put the soy sauce on top for you so you know so you have like that perfect balance of flavors so this is at that level but if you're looking for a great uh casual dining experience and you want to eat sushi this is a great place to try it out it's so good you",

The interior of the four seasons is beautiful creating a wonderful ambiance when we can dine in again! The Afternoon Tea set was delicious and included premium ingredients like caviar, black truffles and decorative items like silver and golf flakes.

    "transcript": "[Music] got to get it right or else they're not going to come back [Music] we just picked up the afternoon tea from the four seasons and honestly first impressions is just wow it's so beautiful all the food looks so delicious and the earl grey tea they gave us is so fragrant it smells so good i can't wait to drink it so right off the bat when you're looking at some of these dishes right off like i can automatically see the prosciutto on top of one of them i can see there's like gold flakes there's silver flakes um there's caviar there's truffles um they're using like really premium ingredients here so then that's where you get like uh the higher price point and i can imagine if you're eating this inside the restaurant how beautiful it is so so some of you might already know the four seasons is known for their extraordinary service and even though it's coded right now that hasn't stopped all their staff are extremely friendly extremely helpful very professional and the interior i've never been inside the four seasons this is my first time and wow it is beautiful in there uh you would love to stay there although it is at a higher price point but it would be a fantastic place to stay so first thing we're going to try uh if you see me looking down because i'm looking at the menu it's the smoked salmon mini muffin so it has a herb sheep's cream uh an aioli caviar and persian cucumber and of course smoked salmon has a caviar sitting on top some gold flakes um and that creamy looking salmon oh that's so good the flav the flavor of the salmon it's like seriously coming out it's so creamy it's so creamy the muffin is so soft the flavors are just popping in your mouth the caviar i actually don't get it that much the creaminess of the salmon actually takes over some of the caviar that you would actually uh taste in other dishes but overall very very good so next we're gonna try the lobster club sandwich it has tomato lettuce and bacon mayo looks so good the bread smells like nicely toasted buttered the bread is like lightly toasted that's not too crunchy it's soft you really get little chunks of lobster inside and the creaminess from um the sauce tomatoes really thin and light as well so this is like some club sandwiches are really heavy this is super super light and delicate um it's really delicious really really good so the next one we're gonna try is the crispy cannoli uh it's a filo pastry with ricotta cheese and black truffles that's what i'm excited for it looks like it has like a pistachio filling inside the outside's like super crispy it's like almost like a spring roll um and then you got that little bit of truffle on top with the cheese so let's dig in that's so good truffles are super fragrant as truffles are strong mushroom taste and you have a really really light filling with the ricotta cheese inside and then the pistachios are just actually just on the outsides a little bit so it adds a little bit of texture that little crunch and the pastry is just so like has so many layers um it's so crunchy but at the same time it's not like hard so it's a light pastry um just layer it out so that it's super fluffy and like it crumbles when you bite into it so the next one we're eating is the eberico ham tartelette it has idiot zabal idiozabal cheese and artichoke it honestly looked like prosciutto to me which i guess is a form of ham but look at this doesn't that look great go ahead ridiculously good you're a fan of prosciutto oh my god this is great the cheese is like it's like the prosciutto itself nice and salty you get that fattiness the creaminess um then you got like this nice puff pastry almost under it it's like you can see the little layers there um crumbles in your mouth when you're eating it and then that little bit of cheese to add that add that like i don't know what's that what's the word for it it's like adds a bit of richness i guess to balance out the the saltiness of the prosciutto and as you're eating it we got the earl grey tea so you get to choose one type of tea that you want with it we chose all gray tastes really good it's not like a your typical earl grey flavor but there's a little like extra hint of floral in it and actually like is really refreshing with that extra bit of floral so now we're off to eat the sweet part of the afternoon tea and we got the linzer cookie which has a berry jam with vanilla shortbread it's so good it's really sweet really sweet a little sourness of the berry and the sugar on top but the cookie itself it's like really buttery it really crumbles in your mouth it's a really good cookie you know how there's a cookie similar to this um i'll put up a picture somewhere but like maybe it's my president's choice it has like that jam in the middle that like they're they're similar in type so still a cookie with jam in the middle that one has like this chewy like 50 day old jam inside this is like fresh jam spread across a freshly baked cookie this is so good it's so much better you like that cookie like forget about that cookie you got to eat this cookie so the next thing we're eating is the ishbahan chok so it's a like a puff pastry it has like um a raspberry and rose whipped ganache and lychee compo here with the heart on top the little bit of silver foil as well nice little puff pastry here oh it's so light yuzu puff pastries have like a harder shell outside of it this is like nice and light you can tell it was like freshly baked like this morning or something and this cream is nice and light too the flavors are not too heavy not too sweet it's a really nice balance so now we've got the cherry cheesecake it's a cheesecake mousse with a cherry gel this thing has a little i think like a flower petal on top of it with a cookie base underneath it oh my god is that soft you got that cheese cookie in the middle but you got that i think it's the raspberry right raspberry like jam covered over it so similar to like your traditional cheesecake right this is just in the form of like a heart shape so got that cheese as that in the middle with the nice coating of the jam on top nice cookie base underneath it's really nice like a tiny little cheesecake with a delicious like it's just so delicious though it's so soft like some cheesecakes are extremely heavy um so it makes it hard to eat a lot of it this is super light so you could i could knock back like five of these like in a row no problem and the last of the sweets we got the chocolate and raspberry mousse it's 70 dark chocolate mousse with some raspberry jam so you have this heart this heart-shaped mousse and the razz bracing on top with some chocolate as the base starting with the chocolate mousse oh you really taste that like 70 chocolate on the bottom you really taste it it's a little bit bitter but that's good to me like i don't like having too much like milk chocolate or like yeah sweeter chocolates having that little bit of business is actually great it's like uh when you're eating all the other sweets together like some of them are sweeter and then this is like one of the things that's not too sweet so that you don't just get like packed like packed with like all this sweetness for your for your last couple of uh bites of the meal this is really good the moose is light and fluffy um and that's that's like key for a good moose so lastly it also comes with two scones so it comes with a regular scone and a raisin scone and it also comes with a bunch of different um jams so this one i smell it it's like an orange jam it smells very fragrant um you got this cream and you have like uh i think it's raspberry or yeah it smells like raspberry jam here so i'm gonna just try um little bites of the scone with each of the jam to let you know how it is first we got orange it's nice you get the acidity of the orange next we got the uh the raspberry this one pops in flavor this will be really good on like some hot toast or something too lastly the cream nice and fluffy this is actually i don't know i don't really like cream with bread it's not like a butter it's actually like a cream not not my favorite for for a scone but the other two the two jams they're great here we have the uh the raisin scone it's in a heart shape again just like everything else for valentine's day as you're eating this going you realize how like buttery it is inside um it's nice and fluffy as well it's not hard you know some some scones get like really like rock solid these ones stay nice and like nice and fluffy and they're soft inside even if you leave them out for a while which we kind of did while we're eating all the other stuff but still really good scone we just finished the afternoon tea from the four seasons from cafe balud and honestly i was i was so happily surprised so happily surprised uh most of the time when you get like an afternoon tea or you go to some new place you just expect like the food is gonna be okay and then the expectation aren't set so high so i went in with that kind of expectation and honestly it blew me away um everything was super delicate super well done every little ingredient that they put in seemed like they had thought to it the flavors balanced out really really nicely and overall i think you cannot go wrong so honestly when things open up or i get another chance i'm going back to cafe balloon i'm going to take you there with me once again and we're going to have an experience of their normal dining and not just their afternoon tea but if you get a chance to do the afternoon tea i say take it it's definitely worth it take your special someone on that nice date you both will enjoy it a lot um and it'll be something for you guys to remember so thanks to all of you for joining me on this valentine's day tour um we have such an incredible meal i'm so happy to share it with you if you like the video uh please think about subscribing to the channel and leaving a like it really helps us out um and also leave the comment down below what's something that you think i should eat what's a great place that

    "description": "Beast Burger, Nashville Hot Chicken Tender Sandwich, Beast Style Fries and Seasoned Crinkle Fries at MR BEAST BURGER's Toronto location at 1071 King St. W, is a very mediocre meal. The burger and sandwich was pretty decent but the beast style fries wasn't very good. There are plenty of local burger joints to visit if you're looking for a great meal. The only real selling point is MR BEAST, and how",

    "transcript": "what's going on it's phil from phil's food review welcome back to the channel if you're new welcome to the channel feel free to subscribe for tons of food adventures and food tours and leave a like on the video if you enjoy so today we're going to a special place made by a youtube creator that has millions and millions of views he gives away money to charity he does tons of good work he has a lot of fun we're going to mr beast [Music] mr b's burger has three locations in toronto um you can find them in the blogto article i'll link it down in the description below um you can order the food through any of the food apps so like ubereats um i think they're also on doordash um so the one we went to um was on king street they're all ghost kitchens so they just have it's just like a kitchen no real storefront and they make it for mr b's burger as well as some other some other restaurant yeah and the one we went to today was on king street and it kind of looked like a construction site we didn't really know where it was we had to kind of look around for it uh just know that it's uh it might be just a random building here and there you're not going to see like a giant mr beast burger sign somewhere else it might be different in the states but here in toronto that's the way it's got to go we ordered two combos and we're gonna go and pick it up so come along for the ride so the first burger we got is the beast style burger so it has delicious two patties you got cheese in there and it looks like a ton a ton of mustard um and some onions as well if you compare this to a lot of other burgers actually quite big of a burger like mcdonald's burgers are probably i don't know like three-fourths the size of this one [Music] it's pretty good i wish i could do like a little bit more with the bun the buns aren't like that special or anything but the meat is really uh nice and juicy it's like really tender has a lot of flavor in it it seasoned it really well uh there's tons and tons of cheese a lot of onions now that i've bitten into it i don't know if you can see it here but tons of onions a ton of mustard it's actually quite good this is definitely like a messier burger but it tastes delicious like i think the patty and the cheese is all really like uh really good but i wish they had something different about the bun the bun seems very like generic um nothing too special about it but the insides are good so then like overall the burger's like all right i wouldn't say it's like better than like a five guys you know five guys is like pretty good in terms like fast food burgers this is kind of like uh right below five guys this next one is the nashville hot uh chicken tender burger so they got like two chicken tenders in the inside uh covered in a nice like hot sauce um as well as like seasoning all over it they have a bit of lettuce i can see maybe a bit of mayo as well um it's like a healthy sized burger one thing i'll say right off the bat after looking at the burger is that i wish there was a little bit more meat there's a lot of burger like a burger bun for the amount of like tenders inside i have a really nice flavor the seasoning is like a little bit spicy it hits you like real hard right at the beginning it's like a nice kick we also got the crinkle fries and had them seasoned so they look like this but they don't they're not really crinkle fries compared to last video when we had um the crinkles fries from pg clutch uh these just look like normal fries with seasoning on them don't it's a normal fry so you can't like any burger place any burger joint but there's a nice like i think it's the same seasoning from the nashville hot chicken it has like a spicy kick to it it's really like a pretty strong kick it like adds up as you're eating it but it's a really nice flavor it's like you get that really like dry heat you know so we also got the b style fries they cut it comes like with a ton of ketchup mustard you got pickles and some i think like some sauteed onions in here as well it really has a really strong like mustard like mustard smell to it this honestly just because all right like i'll be honest with you i'm not a huge fan of mustard so like this doesn't really hit the spot for me maybe if you like mustard a lot you like this you'll like these fries as well but to me these are just like it's all right nothing like crazy special about them they're just like really really messy and sauced up with uh with all the ketchup and mustard so we just finished eating our meal from mr beast burger and honestly overall i thought everything was pretty mediocre uh the burger was all right like it's kind of like your standard burger that you would expect from um just any place that you would see on the street uh the natural hot chicken was actually a little bit above average so like those nice chicken tenders were great in there uh the dry heat from the nashville hot chick the the sauce and the seasoning was really good mixed with like the mayo but the fries were they're not even crinkle fries i don't know what that was about um the seasoning was the same as a nashville hot chicken i think um but they were it just tasted okay and then the mr b style fries were nothing special to me um you kind of just got a ton of mustard and ketchup all over your fries um a little bit of cheese that was like your normal american cheddar like laid out over it i don't know maybe somebody else might like it um but to me uh this wasn't anything special uh sorry mr beast but it's just kind of mediocre if you want to try it out it's like it's all right for a meal right so if you're not looking for anything too crazy you just like want to have a quick bite you want a burger you could go to this joint but aside from that like i wouldn't go out of my way to get it um although i did today so take a recommendation from me if you really want to try it go ahead but i to me there's nothing special if you pass by grab a bite but yeah just don't just don't go out of your way to get it so thanks for coming along for the ride uh feel free to subscribe to the channel drop a like it really helps out and leave a comment on what's a good burger joint um this one was just kind of mediocre i'm looking for something better what's better out there in toronto alright see you next time

    "transcript": "[Music] what's going on welcome back to phil's food review if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button down below and leave me a like if you enjoyed the video smash that like button for that youtube algorithm it honestly really helps out so today we're going to take a korean snack food tour we're going to three different spots and we're going to bring you along with us and everything you're going to see can be bought for less than 10 bucks so it's a real deal come along for the ride and let's get going [Music] so the first place we're going to try is roll this is a korean spot in north york and we got the korean sausage we got tapoke we got the tuna kimbap you can get as a combo or you can get them each separately if you get them all each separately they're like less than 10 bucks each if you get it as a combo i think it's total of like almost 16 bucks i'll put the prices in the descriptions like here ish somewhere on this side so roll is really known for having a lot of different korean street foods so they've been around north york for like ages now it's been like years and they've they've still been there still doing it very well and everything from their place is actually like really really great so first we got the tapoke it's like rice cakes uh fish cakes um all and mixed in with this uh korean spicy sauce it looks really good it's like warming to your heart when you're eating it uh let's take our first spice of this rice cake it's so nice and chewy it's not like hard in the middle it's so delicious the sauce while it is spicy and like it'll keep building as you're eating it but it's really good it's so flavorful and has like a really nice like it's like a sweet a sweet spicy sauce and one of my favorite parts of every dupoki is probably the fish cakes the fish cakes this is so good delicious it's so good so nice and it has like that that little bit of fish flavor that you get with the fish cakes and it's such a like a nice um addition to just having rice cakes like this is one of my favorite favorite korean dishes i love getting this wherever i go so next here we got the tuna kimbap you see this ginormous roll uh looks like it's filled with egg uh they got some carrots in there they got the pickled radish um and the tuna oh it's massive i don't know if i can get this all in one bite okay that was a major mouthful i'm sorry it took so long for me to talk again but there's so much um it's so nicely made the flavors work great it's really like light and refreshing kind of taste to it um it's not very heavy or like very creamy or anything it's very pure in that you're getting like the taste of the vegetables you're getting that pickle from the pickled radish and it works really nicely with that tuna um i've been eating this you easily eat this as like a light snack in the afternoon very easy to eat so what i hear is that a lot of koreans like to dip their kim pop into the tapoke sauce so i'm gonna do that and like let's see how this is i've never tried this actually um it's good there's adds a bit of sweetness to the roll and then a very slight hint of spicy you really don't get that spiciness when you dip it in but you get that sweetness and that actually works really well with the kimbap so this next one's called sunday and it's korean blood sausage with rice inside um and it comes with this salt on the side i think it's some salt and there's a little bit of like there's some sesame in there um some red stuff i'm not actually sure what that is so i'm being told it's pepper flakes um so let's dip it in let's see how it tastes it's really nice i'll be honest with you this isn't my favorite dish but it's it's good like you don't taste like even though it's a blood sausage you don't really taste any of that in it uh you mainly get like texture from the rice inside um i think maybe some clear glass noodles in here as well um and then you dip it with the salt and it adds like that really nice like salt salt and pepper flavor when you eat this there's actually like a fragrance from that blood but it's not like you know like sometimes you eat something that's blood it's like you taste kind of it kind of tastes irony this doesn't you get like a kind of meaty like a meat flavor coming out of it um and that mixes really nicely with like the the rice and the clear noodles our next snack place is called chongqin hot dogs these are korean hot dogs um they're very similar to uh your pogo sticks if you remember that from when you're a kid just like think back right now yeah those pogo sticks from when you were a kid this is just an adult version elevated to another level uh they're like absolutely delicious you go like god i try this place if you haven't tried this place you live in like the gta you live somewhere where you can have access to this you haven't tried it like you have to like you're missing out you've got to go try this so we got the mozzarella with the hot dog inside we got ramen chips covering the outside with some sugar and ketchup on it we also got the squid ink i think the inside is just the hot dog and then we got honey mustard and ketchup so i'm gonna try this one first it's so funny it comes like on on the on a chopstick can't even bite it this thing's like massive i'm having trouble figuring out how to how to attack it first so good so crispy so crunchy they have a really nice fried batter on the outside the ramen chips add a little bit of that crunch like a really big crunch actually not little and you hit that mozzarella in the middle oh let me let me try to get you that that cheese pull when you get cheeseball like that you know it's official it's great if you don't get a cheeseball like man they're using the wrong type of cheese this is some proper mozzarella so it's time to try squid ink i don't think squidding actually as much of a flavor but like let's find out um tastes just as good as the other one this one actually has mozzarella too i didn't know that um the honey mustard actually really good adds a really nice flavor it's like nice and sweet um but yeah and take a great look inside yeah nice batter cheese like how could you ask for anything more just wait till we get to the hot dog party the hot dogs are amazing too and now an asmr break in three two one so lastly we went to sunny dragon this place apparently has really good cha changmin which is like um a black bean based sauce um mixed with noodles it has like onions in it um sometimes it has meat or sometimes that seafood but overall we just we got this one and i think there's only there's a bit of meat inside some meat and some onions with the black bean paste or black bean sauce and it has like these noodles these really chewy noodles so let's let's take our first bite of this has a really nice flavor it's nice and light um overall there's a lot of other places that make changing man but they make it way too heavy on that black bean sauce it's not as nice inflate nice light and delicate in flavor this one is which i think is real a really good thing um and then you have that meat inside you get the texture from like the onions some places just stack it up with i think it becomes like too oily too heavy of a sauce and it's not as enjoyable to eat it makes you feel like really bloated and stuffed after but this one i can see myself eating it like all like i can finish the entire thing and not feel too too heavy um the other thing i gotta mention about this place this seven bucks this seven bucks um you go downtown you try eating at other places probably paying like 13 15 bucks for the same thing so i mean like this is a deal a really great deal you gotta try this it also comes with some pickled radish very common uh side dish and it's nice and refreshing after when you eat these cuts do like the the creaminess of the black bean paste we just finished everything from roll chun chun rice hot dog and sunny dragon everything was absolutely delicious and for under 10 bucks you can't get that value in many other places so i highly recommend you check all three of these places out um the rice dog was so good it's the perfect amount of bun to sausage ratio um comparing to to a hot dog hot dogs suck honestly there's so much bun not enough hot dog this is the complete opposite you got that super crunchy it outside you got the mozzarella or or the hot dog in the middle you got that really nice sauce for the chajang man from sunny dragon you got a super delicious tapoki that's a little bit spicy but also so nicely sweet and creamy so check out all these places i'll link them all in the description box below so you can also take this food tour if you want to or if you want to have just one of these snacks you can go and check them out but thanks for coming along for the ride remember to hit that subscribe button hit the like button helps me out a ton and until next time

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to phil's food review if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe button for tons of food adventures and hit the like button if you enjoy it really helps with that youtube algorithm so today i'm taking you to somewhere so exciting i was so excited when i heard about this place it's called enigma fine dining it's in yorkville the luxury part of town and the chef has some great experience chef quinton bennett has international experience working in cities like cape town south africa all the way to vancouver canada some of his most notable experiences include being a trainee for three months at noma which is in copenhagen known for their redefining of nordic cuisine has previously ranked best restaurant in the world and is now ranked number two with two michelin stars after that he was a senior sous chef for several years at northcote in england serving modern british cuisine and also has one michelin star with that extensive experience he's come to toronto to create his own restaurant named enigma fine dining so one thing i got to tell you guys before we actually start eating the food is that when you order it and you pick it up from their store you have to bring it home with you and you have to put them in the oven so anything that needs warming up they give you this set of instructions for each dish on how you should warm them up before you eat them so that's just one thing to know before we start the meal so we ordered two sets so the first set we got the potato as an appetizer and then we got the patheti which is a puff pastry with red like a vegetable filling inside and the last one we got was an apple crumble and then the second set we got ratatouille with a beef wellington and the beef wonkton serves two people and it's an extra 40 bucks if you wanted to beef wellington the third thing we got was the bread pudding so now let's enjoy the meal this first dish i think is called gratin and it's potato slices and some cream so it looks super creamy it smells delicious this little charred on the top here it's so nice and soft it's really really creamy like i can't imagine how soft these potatoes are really they're like on a next level of sauce like they've been like been cooking and boiling for like hours that's how soft it is and it's just like it melts in your mouth it's so creamy and that flavor is like so rich it's so good the next dish is the ratatouille and unlike the movie um that cartoon where they laid it out really nicely in a circle ratatouille is not really like that it's a stewed vegetable dish so it's gonna look more more so like more or less like this um so let's see how the flavor is though here you can see there's a bit of i think those are cucumbers you got um eggplant you got tomatoes you got bell peppers it's a whole wide array of vegetables that sauce is really nice not sure it tastes tomato based of course maybe with some basil inside it has a really nice light flavor it does taste like you've been stewed um the vegetables are nicely nicely cooked but not overcooked and super mushy they're not undercooked and super crunchy they're like perfect level so this next one is called the fibier i think it's it's a puff pastry stuffed with a bunch of different vegetables and here we got a vegetable juice and then kale i'm just going to cut this right open and then pour some of the sauce right in oh immediately from that crunch you hear it from the from the puff pastry it's super super flaky and right there you see a nice layer of vegetables i can smell a lot of mushroom coming out of this actually so here we got a bit of that vegetable juice just gonna pour it all over it that's nice mmm it's like a sweet a sweet flavor to that that puff pastry is so light so fluffy it's so flaky too it really crumbles in your mouth you can get a whiff of like all that vegetable inside i think there's a lot of mushroom in here like i really have that smell coming from it i'm not i'm not 100 sure but it really tastes good it's such a great flavor the insides are insane and mixed with that sauce that sweetness of the sauce mixed with that vegetable it's so good now that i dig more closing it's almost like there's a maybe a little bit of like squash or there's definitely onion in here maybe some squash or pumpkin also really nice creamy insides to it with that flaky outside it's like a it's like a perfect vegetable pie oh and now some of the kale that goes along with it looks like it's in a cream sauce it's nice and creamy and like a lot of times when you eat kale it's very hard and get really earthy flavor coming out of it this doesn't it's like cooked to perfection it's like just tastes like a very soft vegetable which is typically not really what you get from kale it's really nicely done kale and that creaminess of the sauce is really nicely complementing it yeah i really like this it's like a it's a kale slaw almost in a sense last but certainly not least for the entrees is the beef wellington this is got me so excited it looks so good if you could smell the just the smell of the puff pastry it's like it's so good it's so good it just like makes you like start drooling oh my goodness it's so flaky oh my god you see that middle it's cooked perfectly perfect like medium rare you get the really nice whiff of that beef tenderloin and it's so juicy the juices are already flowing out wow so flaky and beef tenderloin in there just melts in your mouth it's so soft it's not chewy at all and melts in your mouth right when it goes in and pass a punch with flavor that's so much flavor coming out of it juices are really flowing out it's capturing nicely in there so that the juices don't like when you're when it's fully baked juices don't leak out and like make the puff pastry very like very soggy it's really nicely done the crust is amazing like it's just it's absolutely perfect it's so nicely seasoned too there's no way you got this kind of flavor at any normal restaurant this is like really good quality meat really well done puff pastry i'm sure they even they did everything in house it's like so flavorful so good i'm gonna like devour this in a matter of seconds so the beef wellington also came with uh a truffle juice so i'm gonna try this this it smells so fragrant like that truffle flavor was coming out hmm you just get a huge whiff of truffle right when you dip it in when you put in your milk get that truffle instantly it really complements it it infuses so nicely with that beef the truffle and beef combinations just out of this world you really gotta try this for yourself and once you try it i don't think you'll ever go back to another place for beef wellington so our first dessert that we got is the apple crumble and it came with this sauce right off the bat after it comes out of the oven you smell tons of caramel on that apple and it's like perfectly caramelized and like melts it up all together it looks really good and it smells amazing i wish you could smell this it's so soft hmm what a crunch under that crunch from i think it's the caramelized um caramelized sugar on top you know it's so nice and then like the apple it just melts in your mouth like some of them have like chunks of apple i think they have like really thin layers here so that when you're cutting through it it's like perfectly buttery smooth and it just packed with so much flavor it's such a great flavor um there's not many apple crumbles that could get much better than this it's so good as you as i'm eating this i realize it's like a nice whiff of cinnamon and caramel as well and it's so nice um the flavors melt melt together so well it's like a melting pot of all these flavors and it just like swirls around your mouth like with so much aroma it's so beautiful this next one we got is the bread pudding and as i'm looking at it there's like a ton like there's a sauce all over it it looks like it's caramel um maybe i'm wrong i'll i'll see what it is when i bite into it there's some whipped cream on the side and some pistachios over top of it on the box it said croissant pudding so i guess this is a type of croissant that they put instead of like any normal type of bread so i think it is a caramel cream the bread is really nice that caramel adds ton of flavor and the bread has i think some raisins inside and as like when you bite into it as like that kick of flavor all the juices just pop through after taking a couple bites of the bread pudding i realized that there's no it's not much of a croissant at least i don't think it is um it tastes like just like some bread and then with some like raisin bread and then covered with caramel some whipped cream and um the caramel for sure adds like tons of flavor it's really nice so we just wrapped up the meal um overall whatever i think of this place um i think if you dined in it would be so beautiful the environment is amazing i'm sure the plating would be so great as well it's going to be beautiful to your eyes before you eat it um having a takeaway like you obviously don't get that part of the experience but the food itself is really really great so out of the appetizers i like the potato more than the ratatouille ratatouille i don't know i don't see many places that are able to really like elevate ratatouille rather he's like a stew right so it's one of those things that can be done very well and they did um but i don't know what like next level um you can put to it so for the for the mains the entrees i like both of them a lot so the puff pastry was like perfect super flaky uh it's like so so nice to eat um and it's done very well like the beef wonky is a lot though so if you're ordering it like it does tell you it's for two people i just wanted to get it because i want to try it um but it is a really huge portion but it tastes great so if you really want to get that that's one i would definitely recommend um if you get the other one the the vegetable with the puff pastry um that's also very solid very great um and in terms in terms of the desserts i preferred the apple crumble i think that was a top-notch apple crumble like i don't think any place i've ever been to beats that but the bread pudding was like all right i didn't think it was like at that same level as that bread pudding so right now given that everything's takeout um this is like a tremendous value so for 40 bucks you can get all the work you get the appetizer you get the main although i must say there's only two choices for the main at that 40 price point and it that's one of the the puff pastry with the vegetables as well as i think it was a fish everything else if you want something different you have to add a little bit more money but honestly the beef wanted an extra 40 bucks i think that's completely worth it and then dessert like you and you also get dessert with the meal so for 40 bucks i think that's tremendous value um you should totally get this bring it home um bake it up and then eat it you won't regret the meal at all um so huge recommendation huge applause to the chef here did a fantastic job everyone should check it out um if you liked the video please hit that subscribe button down below leave a like let me know in the comments section what other fine dining restaurants are there in toronto or anywhere else that's amazing where have you been that's a great place to be so until next time [Music] peace [Music] wow",

    "title": "BEST Toronto Signature Pizza Review ft. NBA Top Shot Unboxing",
    "description": "We went on an incredible signature pizza tour visiting 4 restaurants in Downtown Toronto. We went to Queen Margherita Pizza, Blondies Pizza, Conzo's Pizza and 8 Mile Detroit Style Pizza. Queen Margherita was definitely the best with their flavorful dough, sweet tomatoes and creamy mozzarella cheese. Watch through the entire video to hear my thoughts on all these pizza joints.\n\nThe 2021 All-Star Ga",

    "transcript": "i don't even think it's like significantly better than the dominoes hey what's going on welcome back to phil's food review i'm here with my boys og pk boy and nick and we're out here trying to do a signature pizza challenge so we're just gonna go around to different places around the city get their signature pizzas and we will review it for you [Music] got queen margarita pizza the tomatoes are really sweet cheese is nice and creamy a bit of olive oil on top and the crust is perfect this is like the best margarita pizza in the entire city maybe aside from like gilaweta possibly like that's the only one that like really rivals this to me like this is what i expect from a margarita pizza like a floppy across not so hard and like crunchy but soft and chewy and then you get like sweetness from the tomatoes obviously you get like a nice like creamy cheese like sometimes the cheese tastes like plastic and i hate that because obviously cheese isn't supposed to taste like plastic we got blondie's pizza uh you can't miss the building it's like all pink that's all you can see the boxes are pink so when you get in there uh we ordered the pizza and it took a long time so just be aware of that every single place i guess because it's a friday night that's our fault takes about like 45 minutes to like an hour and a half depends on the store but this place is really popular tons of people were there picking up pizza so we're gonna try a slice and see how it is so we got the cold drink hot girl pizza they said it was one of their most popular ones it's pretty good we're off the bat get tons of that pepperoni and like it's super crunchy there's a crunchy top to the pepperoni you get some of that heat from the jalapenos it's pretty good the flavor is all right it's not bad flavor and the crust is done pretty nicely too so overall it's like a pretty it's a pretty dope pizza i don't know if it is my favorite though it's just a decently good pizza so it came with some of that dip i think this is something more spicy maybe it looks like a pretty creamy sauce like chipotle sauce look at cheesy maybe chipotle it's a really thick sauce but i kind of like the sauce how how would you rate it i i'd say it's like it's okay it's like a pretty decent pizza i wouldn't order it again though um i could see some other people liking this a lot just because of the toppings um and then the sauce with it but to me this isn't like my favorite pizza um i probably won't order this again honestly going in i didn't know what to expect from body though but because i saw it at like blue quartz activations were pretty low honestly um like this to me is like a franchise pizza this is like what was it 17 bucks yeah 17 bucks for this pizza for a 13 inch yeah for 13 inch for 13 a piece though and i i don't even think it's like significantly better than the domino's like the crust is definitely better than like a domino's or pizza pizza crust 100 dough is better ingredients may be slightly better so maybe like 13 pizza 14 pizza you know what goes really great with pizza some sports and we're going to open up a solid mba pack for you right now all right so we're going to do we're going to do an opening of the all-star game drop from top shot so got it today let's see what it is [Music] [Music] the next one we got is konzo's pizza and i think they gave us a rose is what they said it was um and like first right off the bat like we're looking at the pizza and you see there's like a giant like layer of oil on top i don't know how that is once we're gonna eat it and like the cheese smell is so pungent it's such a strong like strong smell to it let's see if we actually like this one bad huh you like the sauce folks we actually get a lot of the flavor from the parsley i think the cheese is really strong it does like the smell i think it's like a blend of cheeses it looks like there's like mozzarella maybe a bit of cheddar even and parmesan um but it tastes really nice it's just like a really strong and punier flavor from the the cheese uh decent flavor from like the parmesan i mean not the parmesan the parsley on top um and it's actually not as oily as i thought it'd be um it there's definitely still like a little like a layer of like oil on top um but it's not like the typeware is like dripping out like you know some of that cafeteria pizza yeah cafeteria pizza just like you could take a entire like roll of paper towel and try to soak it up and still be too much oil on top it supposed to be a rose sauce but i don't get any flavor of sauce in here i just get straight cheese maybe the cheese is just that strong all i get is like straight cheese from this so console's pizza is like like nick said it was like a lot of cheese and a lot of crust i like hardly get any tomato out of it even though it's a rose pizza um and the crust is kind of like kind of solid i don't really there's like not really much flavor coming out of the crust it's just like it's just kind of there it's all across that i would enjoy eating so this last one that we got eight mile detroit style pizza and i've also had another one another detroit style pizza thing was called defendants that one was really good so i have high expectations for this so but they only told us that their signature was the pepperoni so i mean i don't know how many places have a signature pepperoni pizza but right off the bat when you're like when you feel it when you touch it it's like really heavy and like super oily uh to the touch uh the cheese is like nice and stringy which i like um got that cheese pull and there's a lot a lot of uh pepperonis on top of this dude i felt like that mouthful of oil the cheese although it's like okay there's like a really thick layer of this cheese and it's not like the not the best quality of cheese either you know how like some cheese can be like almost plasticky it's kind of well the feeling i get from it and like the tomato sauce is like normal like very regular tomato sauce with basil in it it's detroit detroit pizzas like a deep dish type style pizza so like you would expect the crust the bottom around the around the pizza to be like kind of crunchy this is just like straight soggy because of the oil dude after i took a bite i felt like i just got like i just i felt like i just put on lip gloss as you can see some of the pepperonis are even burnt so that just like takes away from the pizza even more the crust has an okay crunch to it but overall this pizza doesn't do it for me the other place was way way better like way better i'll go to that place every single time over this one for sure all right so we finished eating all these pizzas and like our overall thoughts are all the same we all like queen margarita the best has the best crust has a lot of flavor it's nice and chewy it has a great sauce to it as well the mozzarella is nice and overall it's just such a great pizza for the second one uh we went blondies right so blondie's was pretty good it's very popular i want to try some of their other pizzas the one we got was just like it was pretty good but i didn't think it was on that tier that like demanded the same kind of popularity that we saw from the shop the third one was kondo's pizza um and honestly i didn't think i like really tasted any of the sauce in there it was just a ton of cheese and bread although like the layer of bread is really thin um overall the flavor of the pizza wasn't like the greatest i thought it was like pretty decent but i honestly wouldn't recommend it myself i wouldn't recommend you go there it's just like my opinion on that so the last one went to eight mile i would definitely not recommend it uh it was way too early i felt like unhealthy about the second as long like it was in my hands i already felt it was unhealthy um nothing about it was that great the sauce was like fairly mediocre same with the same with the cheese and that pepperoni some of them being burnt leaves a bad taste in your mouth i would definitely not recommend this place but overall i would highly recommend that you get queen margherita pizza it's probably like one of the best margarita pizzas in the city i've had eight different i think eight different or like six different margarita pizzas around the city and this one is definitely one of the best uh this and giluetta are like the best margarita pizzas and overall pizzas in general um but if you enjoyed the video leave a like and if you want to see more food adventures so that you know where to put your hard-earned money to subscribe to the channel i'd really appreciate it so until the next adventure peace [Music] you",

    "title": "Is Vegan Sushi WORTH IT? Asian Fusion Food Review @ Planta Queen | Toronto, Canada",
    "description": "We tried Planta Queen for today's food tour, a vegan Asian fusion restaurant in Downtown Toronto, Canada! We ordered their vegan sushi box and the queen classic which included a variety of Asian fusion food. It came with Dan Dan Noodles, Pineapple Fried Rice, Gyoza Dumplings, XO Tofu, Shanghai Slaw, Sorbet and a Coconut Dessert. How do all these stack up for someone who isn't vegan? or even vegeta",

    "transcript": "man not in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible what's going on welcome back to the channel today we're going to plant a queen so my first video that i ever posted on youtube was planet yorkville go check that out if you haven't seen it i'll put it up in the description i think it's this corner um check that out first watch this one after so this one is they're completely different in terms of what they serve on their menus that one at yorkville serves more western food so you got like lasagnas you got pastas you got different salads this one is more like an asian fusion you got different types of sushi or mackie as well as like fried rice dumplings and things like that so i'm joined with ogpk boy and half of the hungry siblings and ogpk boy hates vegetables absolutely hates them so we're bringing him to a vegan place so he can see for himself that there actually is great vegetable great vegan food out there so today we ordered the queen classic so it comes with i guess a wide variety of different items on their menu that's like their signature dishes we also got the sushi platter and let's see how they [Music] are [Music] m i got these gills and dumplings i don't even know what's in them i think some like mushroom and some other vegetables i think there's carrot in it it's pretty good like the crust is all right it's not as crunchy as i thought it'd be but it's very fragrant inside i'm not sure what the fragrance is from though yeah i think it's like a combination of like different vegetables so i think like i i guess some like carrot taste out of it and like a bit of the mushroom but it's actually it's a pretty decent dumpling it's like it's not bad it's pretty good i think the dumplings need it to be a little more fried like the gyoza dumplings would have been nicer it feels a little more fried on the outside um the filling was actually all right it's pretty good um i do kind of wish it was meat though but i guess we are eating vegan food so you can't put that inside overall i think we all agree that um it would have been nicer with meat inside and the vegan version is not as great as like if you were to put some meat in it all right so the next one we got the slaw and it honestly does like when you first open it doesn't look very appealing it comes with a sauce and we just pour it all over it um you got like what some cabbage um a little bit of basil some coriander some onion i'm gonna get like the most sauced up the most sauced up point in this and uh let's see how this tastes it's like a strong whip of coriander holy crap like a licorice flavor there's something shredded in here as well that has like very strong licorice taste so it tastes like licorice and coriander oh and honestly that's not a great combination for me i don't think it is a great artist unfortunately it's kind of like it's like a spicy salad because of that because of that uh licorice taste it's almost like a floral taste to it i think it's like if you mix floral uh licorice coriander all together and create a salad this is kind of what it is really not flavors that i particularly like so to me not a great salad yeah on to the next one next one we got is the xo tofu exo fried tofu so it's like an exo sauce um if you're asian you probably know what this is but um it gives a very like sweet savory flavor to it um and then it's right on top of that fried dumpling or no fried tofu sorry fried tofu it's really fragrant outside the box though like once you open it you get a whiff of that exo exo sauce pretty nice tastes good totally nice and soft it's fried nicely it's not too heavy of a batter and then you got like the actual sauce that like adds that kick of flavor and that's really where like most of the flavor custom is from the exo sauce and the rest is just like kind of texture but it's a really nice tofu and not much unlike regular like chinese dishes that you find that's a really strong exo flavor because they just kind of toss it right on top of that tofu whereas in some other places they mix it in with a sauce that has like a bit of vinegar in it and it like it won't be as strong of a punch it has a more balanced flavor this is like it kind of packs a punch with that exo sauce um because it's just like by itself right on top of that tofu i like it so far felix is a journey through uh yeah but like that's like universally bad for all of us yeah we got the noodles um comes with these egg noodles uh it comes with some cilantro on top as a sauce with these like i guess these like beans i'm not actually sure what they are um i'll try to find them in the description but yeah it comes with this sauce um so it's like egg noodles with kamut it says in the description um traditionally i think it's egg noodles with it's like a spicy and it's like a peanut based sauce um this doesn't smell like or seem like it has any peanut in it but we'll see what the first bite has a nice fragrant flavor to it it has slightly a nutty flavor to it but i'm not sure it's exactly peanut it might be a little bit like a small hint of it or like a sesame sauce in it and then this adds more like a i don't know if this like really adds much to it i don't know what kamut is this honestly reminds me a lot of like a bolognese sauce um where this this commute is creating like a thicker sauce with some texture to it almost similar to like what um in bolognese sauce like a meat would um but it has like that same kind of reminiscence of a donda noodle but not exactly we all just realized that this can't be an egg noodle or else that wouldn't be vegan right so i don't know exactly what it is it's reminiscent of an egg noodle um i don't think it tastes like has that fragrance of the egg but it's still it's not like a very great dish it tastes very good it's like not exactly what i would think a danda noodle is though um so it's like their own take on it i guess overall i think this looks more like a dundal noodle than it does actually tastes like one they put their own like kind of style and mix into it um and it tastes really great but to call it da da noodle i don't think it's like close enough to the traditional one to be called the dun dun noodle all right so next we got the pineapple fried rice it smells super fragrant you got some cashews in there some pineapple um and like it smells like it's been fried with like a lot of sesame oil too which adds like a ton of flavor and fragrance so let's take this first bite it's really nice it's like it's nicely fried and then like the pineapple gives it like a pop of like a juice of that juice so it's like not so dry of like a fried rice like some fried rices are like really super dry um when you add the pineapple in there adds that little bit of juice and then you just got some like cashews to add some like some crunch to it as well pretty solid fried rice i don't think anybody would be disappointed eating this we got the sushi box and try one of each this one's what i'm really like uh interested in because without like sushi mainly you put uh some type of fish or some type of like seafood on it but seeing as vegan can't have any of that so is the substitute really gonna taste the same or is the flavors gonna be there i guess we'll find out so let's take a first bite of this thing i have no idea what this is this looks like avocado with some cream sauce on top and then it's been like torched all right i think that's like cream cheese on top [ __ ] i hate cream cheese any type of sushi i swear to god i think that's cream cheese i'm not exactly sure i'm not hundred percent sure i know i don't like it and the rice is very like very just like mediocre it's like i don't think there's enough vinegar in there there's not really enough flavor coming out of the rice but holy that that like that cream cheese just masks everything i don't even taste avocado all i taste was cream cheese and with like a bit of rice nah man that in it that's not it oh my god that's terrible this next one has some like cashews on it has avocado maybe thin slices of tomato that looks similar to like a salmon and then the middle looks like that same vegetable that produces that licorice flavor um yeah i'll give it a bit liquor's flavor just something that like reminds me a little bit of like like a little bit of tuna that thing on the top i don't know what it is it's a little reminiscent of like the texture of tuna a little bit of the flavor but the combination of flavors to this one is actually not bad it's pretty good um does it do it for me like a tuna would definitely not you can't beat tuna but the flavor for this is actually pretty good it's not bad uh the next one is like a california roll with like avocado once again i feel like avocados and everything here um and then there's another thing that kind of looks like like a faux tuna i don't know i don't know what they use to make make that though i mainly just taste that spicy sauce not really a lot of anything else going on avocado is like a little bit creamy but um yeah it's just like like really creamy with like tiny bit of rice and all i taste is that sauce on top everyone says anything else so this compared to other types of like spicy salmon sushi or something that you at least get some of the texture out of that tuna or the salmon um i don't really get much out of that at all so this next one's this crispy rice thing and once again it looks like it has avocado um and that fake the faux tuna and some like rice krispies on top i don't know which one's all right i think out of all them i might like this one the best because it has different texture it's like it's not really sushi so it's like its own its own thing and then avocados creamy and then the faux tuna um tastes pretty nice it's not there's nothing like that blows my mind for any of these things but this is the this is probably like my favorite out of the bunch so for dessert they gave us a gelato it is a little melted now because we ate everything else and ate this last um i think it was strawberry gelato yeah strawberry gelato uh honestly you can't go wrong with gelato man just tastes good this just tastes like a standard gelato it also came with this other dessert it's sago with uh i think this mango some mango some grass jelly in it too it's like a sago dessert tastes pretty good it's like a it's a nice dessert it was like coconut tapioca with some it seems like mango some grass jelly this tastes really good i i love this type of dessert mangoes are nice and sweet too so we just wrapped up the meal we had so many different things so i'll just tell you what i didn't like and what i did like so i really didn't like that salad that slaw um i thought it was like way too floral in flavor it just didn't sit well with me in my mouth um that's definitely something i don't recommend getting um the sushi platter like for somebody that isn't vegan and i i love eating sushi and raw fish there's no replacement for it this didn't do it for me at all there's things a lot of things there that i didn't like uh that cream cheese type uh sushi the licorice slaw inside one of the sushis um i just felt like the overall balance of flavors really wasn't there whereas like in actual sushi i get that balance of flavors and i get like some really delicious delicious bite so i think my favorite from all the dishes were the daener noodles as well as the fried rice the pineapple fried rice those are both really great i would have them any time no doubt in my mind the desserts were also fantastic but i mean that's not really specific to like a vegan place just sago's really good in general uh sorbet is also very delicious so like there's no going wrong with either of those things the dumplings the gyoza dumplings i felt like i would have preferred having meat in them instead of the vegetable filling with carrots and mushrooms and then that tofu was very delicious as well it was kind of standard so like you could find something similar in a lot of other places but they did it very well i would order it again and i would eat it so let me know what you think about all the food that i tried if you've had it before too let me know if there's other vegan food places that i should check out and thanks for watching the video subscribe down below hit that like button as well and until next time peace ashley hates it he'll gag when he eats eggplant so out here",

that uh in the annotation box somewhere but we're gonna review this we have a whole wide array of food here we got some oysters from diana oyster bar we got some tiger shrimp jumbo tiger shrimp from

i've had this sauce before right but i've never had with seafood like a shrimp it's pretty good with the shrimp but i think that maybe it's better with some meat all right we're trying with some some of these chicken nuggets and dunk them dunk them all over the sauce i don't know how i like it with the with the chicken nuggets oh my god there's two hibiscus like runny yeah maybe a little too runny for for chicken nugget dipping sauce like these chicken nuggets you gotta really eat it with something sweet yeah they need something sweeter or like super salty like ketchup it's like most of the dipping sauces from mcdonald's is gonna be us on the sweeter side but this isn't really um sweet it has like a more there's like vinegar in it so it has like more of a i don't know more of a savory more of a savory tone to it than like a sweet one a little zest in it a little heat yeah it's like a little bit of acidity with the vinegar and then like i don't think that really goes well with the chicken nugget but it probably tastes bomb with those with those wings though hold on let's give it a try go for a drumstick bearing techniques for sure they're like perfect with chicken yeah nice you can have this as like the what number number two number three sauce on hot ones yeah calling you out hot ones try out the sauce put it on your channel this is good i definitely think this is much better than it being on both the shrimp and the chicken nuggets well i guess like that's most hot sauces just messed with chicken wing yeah so here we're going to try with some of these like these massive oysters when i first tried this sauce i tried it on its own and i felt like it was a mixture of like almost like a seafood sauce with spice but obviously after we're eating this it doesn't really taste like that it's more zesty so i don't know how it's actually going to be with these oysters i thought initially it might be great with oysters but let's try it out let's try it whenever you're ready bro cheers naturally when you eat oysters a lot of people already put vinegar they put like some lemon juice in it so like you get that zest and then you also add like hot sauce to oysters sometimes so this is like a perfect mixture it has some of that heat has a bit of vinegar has that zest so it's like a combination of all the flavors that you normally would put on oyster yeah all packed into one so it actually tastes really good with oysters so this sauce one of our friends actually created it so full disclosure this is a product our friend created but we love it enough to promote it as well so we're not getting paid nothing no sponsorship nothing like that we just really like the sauce and it's one of our good friends so i think this is a fantastic sauce so when we were at a cottage he actually gave us samples to try yeah he had i think even before the cottage he had like 14 different samples of sauces he came over to my place and we just tested them all out and he did this with a couple groups so this one the bird eye was the one that rained supreme it's like the more on the spicier side but overall they kind of kicked it down a notch for the end result so it's it's it's a balance of there is a kick but it's also very good flavor very light and acidic and has strong like citrus flavors into it too yeah so after all that he came out with this final product and it actually tastes really great you can get the sauce if you're interested downtown at mcewens and wild and fresh on cane spadina so these two grocery stores do sell his sauce and you can also get this online on their own website so we'll link it down in the description box below you guys can check it out if you want to buy it i highly recommend you try it out it's actually a really good sauce if you want to compare this to like a tabasco like tabasco's really plain it's very normal um i don't think it's that great of a hot sauce this is fantastic you put on a lot of different types of food like out of these four here we really liked it with both the oyster and the chicken wings not so much the shrimp or the nuggets but i mean every sauce is complemented uh compliments a different food really well and we think these two are the ones that were good so six heat just like its namesake comes from the six so the gta is a local business so if you want to support local i highly suggest you buy this hot sauce try it out for yourself um and drink you from the six right come on help support some hot sauce help support a small business man if you enjoyed the video what do

    "transcript": "what's going on welcome back to the channel today i got a super exciting meal for you guys so we got an amex offer and they're giving us uh two full sets from toca a restaurant within the risk carlton for 85 and after looking at the prices on toka's actual menu this is an absolute steal so i'll put the prices up on the screen and you guys can look for yourself and see what the savings are like so we're going over to the risk carlton now to pick up the meal this is a special offer from amex for amex card holders only so we're gonna walk through the entire meal with you guys so you can see if it's worth for you to try toca and if you want you can also apply to get an amex card and get these type of deals as well so we just picked up the meal let's get eating so for the appetizer we have burrata it's butternut squash chutney with caramelized papitas uh arugula and grapefruit um and i guess it came with some crostini as well to like go along with it so here we got the crostini with the cheese on top as well as some of the pear it's so crunchy look crostini it's almost like a crouton that cheese is so creamy so so creamy that pear has some really nice like nice sweet flavor to it it really like blends together really nicely on its own it's actually really good too i think it's like buttered up maybe a bit of yeah i think they have a nice layer of butter on there so it's like super crunchy has that buttery texture that butter flavor as well by itself it tastes really great there's like a huge amount of cheese for the amount of crostini so you gotta eat some of it on its own as well the insides are nice and fluffy and there's a stretchiness almost like mozzarella on the outside of it tastes really really great so some of you may be wondering why a cheese dish with crostini is going to be mixed with some fruit it's because it's so creamy the cheese by itself and even just with the the crostini it's already buttered up so there's a lot of like richness coming from it so you need some type of use something to balance that out and that's where the sauce uh with the arugula as well as that fruit come in to really give it a type of balance so that your mouth isn't just like overflowed with richness i know before i said there might not be enough crostini for all the cheese but i forgot that they gave us two boxes of cristini's so maybe that is enough christine next we got the grilled atlantic salmon and it comes with a base that has some carrots it has mussels and lobster in it as well sauce here saffron butter sauce and it smells like it's infused with some some lobster in there as well it's so so fragrant like you smell it it's so delicious it makes you salivate like right away oh my god that's so good that skin is like grilled like so it's crispy it's nice and crispy it's really really delicious it has a really nice taste to it they season it so perfectly and the salmon is cooked so nicely it's very like nice and flaky it's this this dish is like blowing me away it's really delicious and then some of that uh some of that base with the with the carrots and maybe some potato and the lobster dash will nice oh nice chunks of lobster in here oh my god there's a couple chunks in there under the under the salmon so soft so delicious like lobster you can't beat lobster it's so good found a nice little muscle here soaked up all the flavor oh so good so good this dish is like very very good i would order this like 10 out of 10 times that i go here this is probably like one of the best dishes i've had on this channel so far so next we got the cornish hen with potato chickpeas broccolini and a romesco sauce um right off the bat when you open this up you smell like a huge whiff of like uh of seasoning so i think some type of like rosemary possibly um and like it's just such a delicious smell it smells so good um yeah it's just so good so let's first try some of that cornish hen did you see i even took pieces of breast first a really nice flavor to it seasoned well real nicely so that skin has a little top coat that's a little bit like crunchy to it very nice corner time we've got potatoes i feel like it's been nicely pan fried in some butter with some olive oil looks like there's a bit of basil on top of it like mixed in with it and some pepper as well a really nice flavor to that potato i love how they pan fried it nicely so that there's a slight crispy edge to it and then the middles are still super soft though got this broccolini that's also been uh it looks like it's also been grilled nice taste to it hasn't built like grow to the point where it's like super mushy it's still crunchy and you can hear that right off the bat once you bite into it um and it's nicely seasoned as well it has that same seasoning that i think the potatoes does so now i'm going to try some of that romesco sauce it's almost like like a curry paste you know almost a sense it has it has like it's a really grainy and like it's a really huge pop of flavor huge pop of flavor um but yeah it tastes like there's been mixed in with a lot of different spices to create that sauce and it really complements the the cornish hand very well so i just kind of looked up what a romesco sauce is and it's a combination of things like tomato garlic almonds pine nuts hazelnut olive oil and olives so i guess that's why it's it's like a thicker sauce and it's like noticeably thick like it's not as viscous and like it's a really huge pop of flavor and it's like a really huge pop of flavor um but yeah it tastes like

    "title": "TIKTOK Viral Brunch Box Takeout from Light Café Toronto",
    "description": "Located in Toronto, Light Café's brunch box has been viral all over TikTok, they have a beautiful spread that's aesthetically pleasing and delicious to look at. The restaurant is a Taiwanese inspired Café but I don't really see the influence in the majority of their offering. The box includes various amount of brunch favorites including a croissant, mini pancakes, smoked salmon, waffles fries, egg",

    "transcript": "what's going on today we're going to like cafe to get their brunch box it's been viral all over tik tok we're going to review the entire thing and let you know if it's worth it [Music] so we got back i thought i'd do something more casual today and we're just going to eat straight out of the trunk so we're going to tailgate this and we're going to get on with the review so looking at everything it's a really beautiful display it's really nice looking box i see why everyone's posting on tiktok and instagram it's just very aesthetically pleasing so if you had this boxer for you right now leave in a comment down below what would you start with first i think i'm gonna go with the waffle fries um looks pretty good has a nice crunch to it not too crunchy and you can still taste the potatoes because it's slightly nice and fluffy on the inside these waffle fries are actually pretty good but they don't compare anything close to chicas if you've been to chicas downtown their waffle fries are some of the best i've ever had and honestly they could be some of the best in the entire world you never know next i think i'm gonna go with that croissant it looks nice and fluffy it looks flaky um it looks pretty good actually you see all those layers on the inside that means it's nice and fluffy it's probably going to be delicious to eat it's so nice and flaky it has a nice like buttery outside to it really soft on the inside it's really nice to crumble like crazy so back in my trunk's gonna be filled with some croissant but it's pretty good croissant actually i think they might have cooked it a little too long i can almost taste like a slight little bit of like burnt on it but it's not bad honestly it's pretty good so you get a lot of different choices of what kind of eggs you want i went with the eggs benedict you can get like scrambled you can get sunny-side up whatever you want so i'm gonna try to get you a shot of that runny oak when i first cut into it come here come close well that was a little disappointing uh so when you get like a post egg with some holiday sauce for eggs benedict it's supposed to be runny like really runny so once you cut into it it's supposed to ooze on now it looks really really delicious but unfortunately this one's like almost cooked all the way through which is like very very disappointing that's like that's not the proper way to cook like a poached egg with some hollandaise sauce although the egg was a little disappointing let's see how it tastes though it's not bad the holiday sauce could use a bit more sweetness to it i feel like it's a little a little on the blander side but the egg is tastes pretty good like the at the outside the egg white tastes good um i just wish it were runny man that's all i asked for when i when i order it eggs benedict come on as you can see when you dig to the bottom of that egg there's actually a little bit a little bit of runny yolk i wish there was much more though that would make for much better egg next it looks like we got some breakfast sausage in here as well honestly very standard um same ones you would find out like a hotel breakfast or like very standard stuff like it's nothing special just tastes like a normal sausage i wish they would would have done something like better i wish they had done something like homemade this is not that great we also got some nicely fried up bacon so honestly bacon you just can't go wrong no matter like what kind of bacon you got as long as pork bacon don't don't give me none of that turkey bacon you know but as long as you got this this is always good you can't ever go wrong there's nothing wrong you can do with it you just fry it up and you eat it tastes like basically tastes a little smoky nice and fatty exactly what bacon is everything you love about bacon so when you're ordering the meal you got an option of all these different types of meat so you get like when you have lobster you have smoked salmon you can get i think pulled pork and like a vegetarian option so i went on with the smoked salmon i love smoked salmon so let me tell you a little story when i was back in university it was my study snack i had that frozen uh smoked salmon on my on my desk with some crackers put them together and then got a nice snack for studying that's how much i love smoked salmon [Music] nice smoky flavor texture of the salmon it's so nice it's like the perfect balance of uh raw salmon and cooked salmon and has such a nice smoky flavor to it but honestly this one doesn't taste much different from the frozen salmon that you get at your local go supermarket loblaws or something grab that frozen salmon defrost it you got yourself pretty much the same thing so one thing you've got to do and i'm going to do it right now for you uh you got to get that croissant you got to put some of that salmon onto some of that egg put it all together and have it in one full bite because honestly that is a great amazing combination right here right here so bad that's how you properly eat this combination of food together put all together like a sandwich and you just dig in they put in a garden salad as well so you got these nice green leaves decently fresh um honestly there's not much wrong can go with doing like a garden salad it's just pretty simple it's pretty plain and honestly it feels like a space filler i guess the salad is kind of there just to balance everything else off so that you're not just eating a lot of heavy fattening stuff like hangover food like hangover oily fat food you're not having just all of that you got a little bit of salad there just to make you feel like you're a little healthier so the last and most exciting part are these mini pancakes they look really nice and fluffy got some syrup with it as well to look really nice has a really good flavor on its own even without the syrup it has a good flavor to it and it's nice and soft in the middle actually really good i really like this actually i've been out of all the things here this is the thing that i like most and you can order the entire you can order the same box with just way more of these pancakes too i think that's one of the options you should definitely do that one pancakes also came with a couple of berries nice and sweet some nice fresh fruit really goes well with the entire meal it's like cafe supposed to be a taiwanese inspired cafe but nothing about the maine to me screams out that it's been inspired by taiwan at all honestly they sell like pasta salads and these brunch boxes and nothing really taiwanese about them uh the only thing on their menu that seems taiwanese is their drinks like there might be some like bubble tea kind of flavors and uh like smoothies and stuff like that um so it's a little confusing you know so what are my thoughts on the entire brunch box i really wish that they actually did the egg properly um that would have made the meal a little bit better i wish that does something other than that regular like garden salad very normal very regular a lot of places do it nobody actually most places don't actually do it right or like do it nicely they just kind of throw a salad together and just like toss it there um honestly it's like a forgettable thing on in the entire box it's nothing you don't even need it there like you could put something else there and make it better uh instead of having this random salad you know yeah i think it's very average so there's nothing that really stands out to be like oh yeah this is a great place you gotta try this brunch place out um the pancakes were really great and i think i would get those again the rest of the box was like just you know average and i can't say that i would recommend it over any other like breakfast place that's pretty good like if you talk about emojis temple or something like i can't recommend it over that um this is just very average and like it provides pretty decent value for like 20 bucks you get quite a bit of food um and it's definitely better than getting like a 16 uh avocado toast but will i return to get this again uh maybe maybe i get i come back to get the pancakes again but that's about it to me this meal is like a one and done and like not particularly in a good way so like a good one and done is like zion goes to college for one year goes into the draft goes into the nba this is the bad one where like you enter the draft but you don't make it so like i wouldn't come here again most likely unless like somebody else that i know want to come here with me uh then i'll cope but aside from that i'm not gonna return just for this box um that's my recommendation to you you can check it out if you want to but honestly it's nothing that special it's just really hyped up with tech talk and instagram and all that so if you enjoyed the video let me know in the comments below leave a like on the video and follow me

    "transcript": "welcome to phil's food review today we're going to plant a vegan restaurant downtown uh they have multiple locations but we're going to the yorkville one so let's go uh let's see how it is [Music] we got the caesar salad let's try the caesar mix in the sauce how is it it's pretty good it's not too different from any normal caesar salad so you like the pickled you got some i think one of these pickled rashes here sauce is quite good the mushrooms give it a little bit more earthiness a bit more meatiness that you otherwise would have had like bacon bits for instead it's not bad it's pretty good pretty good salad this is the mixed green i like this these are the the sauce for this very refreshing this had a much uh oilier based salad dressing it's some pink stuff i don't know what it is [Music] isn't there refreshing that's quite refreshing it's quite nice quite light almost like a vinaigrette which one do you like more i like both actually i like the season more i've always loved caesar salads more than any other salads i like the seasoning for that though that's why if you're looking for a lighter meal this is definitely a one pack see your styles are a little bit more filling just because of the sauce especially and you get like croutons and like in this case mushrooms i like the mushroom hmm quite nice you're gonna try the egg plant lasagna those eggplant eggplant lasagna i don't typically eat vegan food but i thought i'd give it a shot let's see how it is it's quite good the sauce is very flavorful the eggplant gives it a little meaty texture or not meaty texture but just a little more uh i don't know a little more filling a piece of the eggplant it's good i thought eating vegan food i'd miss the meaty part or meat of within any of the dishes but it's still very good without it i don't miss that at all is it tomato based yeah the lasagna i actually like the eggplant it sticks everything together so it's layered perfectly every time you try to eat it whereas meat it like crumbles out and like you gotta like kind of scoop it all up and have it in one bite so as i was eating the lasagna i actually found this like patty almost looks like a beef patty but it's obviously not beef i don't know what it is which is quite nice what is that i think this is where it makes it seem more meaty is this patty but i don't know what it is don't know where is there the eggplant i just ground up eggplant it's not like pieces of eggplant they had pieces of eggplant in one of the layers but this was like they blended something up and made this into a patty it obviously doesn't taste like meat but it's it gives it that half that meat usually provides here mushroom bones smells very mushy very strong very strong very pungent so if you don't like mushroom or you don't like the smell of mushroom this isn't going to be for you it's okay this one it's just like a white sauce with mushrooms in it mushroom tastes very strong but i don't really like this pasta this type of pasta that much this definitely isn't my favorite pasta i think just the pasta itself isn't my favorite and then you add the sauce that's very heavy on the mushroom side i like mushroom but i don't know it just doesn't does doesn't do it for me you know what this reminds me of you know campbell's soup has like like a mushroom cream soup reminds me exactly of that way heavier on the mushroom when you get pieces of mushroom and then they just like it's very strong mixed with the pasta definitely not my favorite i'll just lasagna a lot more i can eat it but i wouldn't order it again 100 one order again the pasta is a little weird i think maybe that's just our preference maybe it's like a little roll to plant a vegan restaurant in the heart of yorkville where my thoughts i would say eggplant was delicious same with the caesar salad or both salads for that matter but the mushroom the mushroom pasta was a little too strong on the mushroom and the pasta just wasn't my favorite maybe that's just my personal preference um but i definitely go here again it's a great it's a great place to eat the environment looks beautiful when we can actually go eat in the restaurant again uh but yeah it's overall very good give it a try uh leave a like subscribe and yeah see you next time [Music] um you",

They take Halal Chicken from Sargent Farms, debone the leg meat, brine it for 24 hours in a lemon and herb, then put it in buttermilk for 6 hours and dredge it twice for extra crispness. They specialize in sandwiches and Nashville style Hot Chicken!",

    "transcript": "what's going on it's phil from phil's free review welcome back to the channel today we're going to one of my favorite chicken burger places in all in the entire city uh national post named this place best fried chicken in canada and blocktio says they're the best fried chicken in toronto so this place called pg clucks we put our order so let's go [Music] this is the jalapeno and honey spicy burger spicy chicken burger from pg klux uh first impressions when you look at it there's so many jalapenos i'm a little afraid it's gonna be really spicy um and the chicken looks really juicy it's like nicely fried up um the one thing like first off the bat when i look at it is the bun looks a little soggy on the top but let's take a first bite and see how it is you fried up that that chicken and it's so juicy look there's no other comparison to this they have some of the best fried chicken sandwiches you can ever find i don't know how they keep it so moist inside and have it fried on the outside still pretty crazy how good it is as i'm eating it it's actually not that spicy if you can take jalapenos you can take the spicy beverage of this for this burger it's really not that spicy you have like nothing to be afraid of if you can take jalapenos you're good some bite to this you really get that honey mixed in with that chicken so it's like um it's almost similar to that chicken and waffle vibe where you got that sweetness and then it goes well with like the fried uh the fried chicken it's a really nice combination i really love that um and they've done it so well here like this this burger is so solid it's like if you're talking about kfc popeyes chicken burgers they don't compare they're not even on the same level this is completely different this is top of the city best in the city um you're not really going to find anything much better than this at least i haven't so you really got to eat this burger and try it for yourself next we just got three pieces of their fried chicken there's one spicy at the end there um and two non-spicy uh these honestly don't look you're like your traditional fried chicken it's not like uh like bone-in like bone-in thigh or it's not like a drumstick this just this looks like the same patty that they're kind of using for their burgers but just by the chicken the chicken by itself so i'm gonna take a bite of bite of each one let you know how it is it's just as good as a burger it's so juicy and so moist inside that crust is nice and nice and crispy like you hear that crunch on every bite it tastes so good and here we got the spicy one it looks like they just they toss a bunch of uh like spicy powder uh like chili powder on top of it it's like covered in it let's hope this is not too spicy it's actually not that spicy it adds like that slight kick to the chili and that's that's kind of it it has like a decent flavor but i don't know i don't think the powder like this chili this chili powder adds um as much flavor as i thought it might but once again the chicken is so moist it's so delicious like you can't go wrong piece you want to get spicy non-spicy they're both going to be delicious and next we have the crinkle fries you can see how delicious those look look nice and delicious oh it's so crispy it's so nice it's nicely salted you don't even need anything to go with this eat these alone and they're delicious and there's not much better than this i thought i haven't had crinkle fries in a long time this reminds me of shake like shake shack fries but way better than shake shack fries chicken fries kind of dull actually last time i had it when i look at it more closely they actually have some seasoning on top of this as well i'm not sure what the seasoning is but it's it's really delicious so another side that we got with the with the chicken and the burger is this macaroni salad like a yeah it's macaroni salad actually there's nothing special it's not that great actually um it's kind of just like a mediocre macaroni salad yeah not great you're better off getting double crinkle fries instead of this so it also came with these sauces so i'm going to try with some some fries see what they're like this almost i was like a vinegary mustardy taste it's okay like i don't think this necessarily like makes the it doesn't necessarily complement the fries that well i don't know how it is on the chicken i think this one's just your classic ranch um yeah if you like ranch sauce this is a good one um you dip it with your fries your chicken it's classic ranch so we're gonna finish up the food and then when we come back i'll i'll share with you some of my thoughts on on pg clogs and all the food that we got today so how was pg clucks overall i would say the sandwich was bomb it was so juicy it's so flavorful and you're not going to find anything close to it in the city so chick-fil-a kfc popeyes nothing compares to it so you got to try that out as for the fried chicken pieces themselves they're similar to what the sandwich is i honestly prefer the sandwich myself if you were to go with just one thing go with one of their sandwiches as for the crinkle fries those are so good it seasoned perfectly you wouldn't need any additional condiments on the side or anything like that um they're top notch as for that macaroni salad that really isn't it i didn't like it and i don't think you should order it you should pay the extra two bucks get more critical fries you won't regret it overall i really think you should try pg clucks if you like the video smash that like button and subscribe it really helps with that youtube algorithm and leave me a comment below do you think there's a better fried chicken sandwich place in the entire gta thanks for watching see you next time [Music] you",

already know the four seasons is known for their extraordinary service and even though it's coded right now that hasn't stopped all their staff are extremely friendly extremely helpful very professional and the interior i've never been inside the four seasons this is my first time and wow it is beautiful in there uh you would love to stay there although it is at a higher price point but it would be a fantastic place to stay so first thing we're going to try uh if you see me looking down because i'm looking at the menu it's the smoked salmon mini muffin so it has a herb sheep's cream uh an aioli caviar and persian cucumber and of course smoked salmon has a caviar sitting on top some gold flakes um and that creamy looking salmon oh that's so good the flav the flavor of the salmon it's like seriously coming out it's so creamy it's so creamy the muffin is so soft the flavors are just popping in your mouth the caviar i actually don't get it that much the creaminess of the salmon actually takes over some of the caviar that you would actually uh taste in other dishes but overall very very good so next we're gonna try the lobster club sandwich it has tomato lettuce and bacon mayo looks so good the bread smells like nicely toasted buttered the bread is like lightly toasted that's not too crunchy it's soft you really get little chunks of lobster inside and the creaminess from um the sauce tomatoes really thin and light as well so this is like some club sandwiches are really heavy this is super super light and delicate um it's really delicious really really good so the next one we're gonna try is the crispy cannoli uh it's a filo pastry with ricotta cheese and black truffles that's what i'm excited for it looks like it has like a pistachio filling inside the outside's like super crispy it's like almost like a spring roll um and then you got that little bit of truffle on top with the cheese so let's dig in that's so good truffles are super fragrant as truffles are strong mushroom taste and you have a really really light filling with the ricotta cheese inside and then the pistachios are just actually just on the outsides a little bit so it adds a little bit of texture that little crunch and the pastry is just so like has so many layers um it's so crunchy but at the same time it's not like hard so it's a light pastry um just layer it out so that it's super fluffy and like it crumbles when you bite into it so the next one we're eating is the eberico ham tartelette it has idiot zabal idiozabal cheese and artichoke it honestly looked like prosciutto to me which i guess is a form of ham but look at this doesn't that look great go ahead ridiculously good you're a fan of prosciutto oh my god this is great the cheese is like it's like the prosciutto itself nice and salty you get that fattiness the creaminess um then you got like this nice puff pastry almost under it it's like you can see the little layers there um crumbles in your mouth when you're eating it and then that little bit of cheese to add that add that like i don't know what's that what's the word for it it's like adds a bit of richness i guess to balance out the the saltiness of the prosciutto and as you're eating it we got the earl grey tea so you get to choose one type of tea that you want with it we chose all gray tastes really good it's not like a your typical earl grey flavor but there's a little like extra hint of floral in it and actually like is really refreshing with that extra bit of floral so now we're off to eat the sweet part of the afternoon tea and we got the linzer cookie which has a berry jam with vanilla shortbread it's so good it's really sweet really sweet a little sourness of the berry and the sugar on top but the cookie itself it's like really buttery it really crumbles in your mouth it's a really good cookie you know how there's a cookie similar to this um i'll put up a picture somewhere but like maybe it's my president's choice it has like that jam in the middle that like they're they're similar in type so still a cookie with jam in the middle that one has like this chewy like 50 day old jam inside this is like fresh jam spread across a freshly baked cookie this is so good it's so much better you like that cookie like forget about that cookie you got to eat this cookie so the next thing we're eating is the ishbahan chok so it's a like a puff pastry it has like um a raspberry and rose whipped ganache and lychee compo here with the heart on top the little bit of silver foil as well nice little puff pastry here oh it's so light yuzu puff pastries have like a harder shell outside of it this is like nice and light you can tell it was like freshly baked like this morning or something and this cream is nice and light too the flavors are not too heavy not too sweet it's a really nice balance so now we've got the cherry cheesecake it's a cheesecake mousse with a cherry gel this thing has a little i think like a flower petal on top of it with a cookie base underneath it oh my god is that soft you got that cheese cookie in the middle but you got that i think it's the raspberry right raspberry like jam covered over it so similar to like your traditional cheesecake right this is just in the form of like a heart shape so got that cheese as that in the middle with the nice coating of the jam on top nice cookie base underneath it's really nice like a tiny little cheesecake with a delicious like it's just so delicious though it's so soft like some cheesecakes are extremely heavy um so it makes it hard to eat a lot of it this is super light so you could i could knock back like five of these like in a row no problem and the last of the sweets we got the chocolate and raspberry mousse it's 70 dark chocolate mousse with some raspberry jam so you have this heart this heart-shaped mousse and the razz bracing on top with some chocolate as the base starting with the chocolate mousse oh you really taste that like 70 chocolate on the bottom you really taste it it's a little bit bitter but that's good to me like i don't like having too much like milk chocolate or like yeah sweeter chocolates having that little bit of business is actually great it's like uh when you're eating all the other sweets together like some of them are sweeter and then this is like one of the things that's not too sweet so that you don't just get like packed like packed with like all this sweetness for your for your last couple of uh bites of the meal this is really good the moose is light and fluffy um and that's that's like key for a good moose so lastly it also comes with two scones so it comes with a regular scone and a raisin scone and it also comes with a bunch of different um jams so this one i smell it it's like an orange jam it smells very fragrant um you got this cream and you have like uh i think it's raspberry or yeah it smells like raspberry jam here so i'm gonna just try um little bites of the scone with each of the jam to let you know how it is first we got orange it's nice you get the acidity of the orange next we got the uh the raspberry this one pops in flavor this will be really good on like some hot toast or something too lastly the cream nice and fluffy this is actually i don't know i don't really like cream with bread it's not like a butter it's actually like a cream not not my favorite for for a scone but the other two the two jams they're great here we have the uh the raisin scone it's in a heart shape again just like everything else for valentine's day as you're eating this going you realize how like buttery it is inside um it's nice and fluffy as well it's not hard you know some some scones get like really like rock solid these ones stay nice and like nice and fluffy and they're soft inside even if you leave them out for a while which we kind of did while we're eating all the other stuff but still really good scone we just finished the afternoon tea from the four seasons from cafe balud and honestly i was i was so happily surprised so happily surprised uh most of the time when you get like an afternoon tea or you go to some new place you just expect like the food is gonna be okay and then the expectation aren't set so high so i went in with that kind of expectation and honestly it blew me away um everything was super delicate super well done every little ingredient that they put in seemed like they had thought to it the flavors balanced out really really nicely and overall i think you cannot go wrong so honestly when things open up or i get another chance i'm going back to cafe balloon i'm going to take you there with me once again and we're going to have an experience of their normal dining and not just their afternoon tea but if you get a chance to do the afternoon tea i say take it it's definitely worth it take your special someone on that nice date you both will enjoy it a lot um and it'll be something for you guys to remember so thanks to all of you for joining me on this valentine's day tour um we have such an incredible meal i'm so happy to share it with you if you like the video uh please think about subscribing to the channel and leaving a like it really helps us out um and also leave the comment down below what's something that you think i should eat what's a great place that you were surprised about um and i'll go try it as well so thanks for watching see you next time peace",

    "description": "Beast Burger, Nashville Hot Chicken Tender Sandwich, Beast Style Fries and Seasoned Crinkle Fries at MR BEAST BURGER's Toronto location at 1071 King St. W, is a very mediocre meal. The burger and sandwich was pretty decent but the beast style fries wasn't very good. There are plenty of local burger joints to visit if you're looking for a great meal. The only real selling point is MR BEAST, and how",

    "transcript": "what's going on it's phil from phil's food review welcome back to the channel if you're new welcome to the channel feel free to subscribe for tons of food adventures and food tours and leave a like on the video if you enjoy so today we're going to a special place made by a youtube creator that has millions and millions of views he gives away money to charity he does tons of good work he has a lot of fun we're going to mr beast [Music] mr b's burger has three locations in toronto um you can find them in the blogto article i'll link it down in the description below um you can order the food through any of the food apps so like ubereats um i think they're also on doordash um so the one we went to um was on king street they're all ghost kitchens so they just have it's just like a kitchen no real storefront and they make it for mr b's burger as well as some other some other restaurant yeah and the one we went to today was on king street and it kind of looked like a construction site we didn't really know where it was we had to kind of look around for it uh just know that it's uh it might be just a random building here and there you're not going to see like a giant mr beast burger sign somewhere else it might be different in the states but here in toronto that's the way it's got to go we ordered two combos and we're gonna go and pick it up so come along for the ride so the first burger we got is the beast style burger so it has delicious two patties you got cheese in there and it looks like a ton a ton of mustard um and some onions as well if you compare this to a lot of other burgers actually quite big of a burger like mcdonald's burgers are probably i don't know like three-fourths the size of this one [Music] it's pretty good i wish i could do like a little bit more with the bun the buns aren't like that special or anything but the meat is really uh nice and juicy it's like really tender has a lot of flavor in it it seasoned it really well uh there's tons and tons of cheese a lot of onions now that i've bitten into it i don't know if you can see it here but tons of onions a ton of mustard it's actually quite good this is definitely like a messier burger but it tastes delicious like i think the patty and the cheese is all really like uh really good but i wish they had something different about the bun the bun seems very like generic um nothing too special about it but the insides are good so then like overall the burger's like all right i wouldn't say it's like better than like a five guys you know five guys is like pretty good in terms like fast food burgers this is kind of like uh right below five guys this next one is the nashville hot uh chicken tender burger so they got like two chicken tenders in the inside uh covered in a nice like hot sauce um as well as like seasoning all over it they have a bit of lettuce i can see maybe a bit of mayo as well um it's like a healthy sized burger one thing i'll say right off the bat after looking at the burger is that i wish there was a little bit more meat there's a lot of burger like a burger bun for the amount of like tenders inside i have a really nice flavor the seasoning is like a little bit spicy it hits you like real hard right at the beginning it's like a nice kick we also got the crinkle fries and had them seasoned so they look like this but they don't they're not really crinkle fries compared to last video when we had um the crinkles fries from pg clutch uh these just look like normal fries with seasoning on them don't it's a normal fry so you can't like any burger place any burger joint but there's a nice like i think it's the same seasoning from the nashville hot chicken it has like a spicy kick to it it's really like a pretty strong kick it like adds up as you're eating it but it's a really nice flavor it's like you get that really like dry heat you know so we also got the b style fries they cut it comes like with a ton of ketchup mustard you got pickles and some i think like some sauteed onions in here as well it really has a really strong like mustard like mustard smell to it this honestly just because all right like i'll be honest with you i'm not a huge fan of mustard so like this doesn't really hit the spot for me maybe if you like mustard a lot you like this you'll like these fries as well but to me these are just like it's all right nothing like crazy special about them they're just like really really messy and sauced up with uh with all the ketchup and mustard so we just finished eating our meal from mr beast burger and honestly overall i thought everything was pretty mediocre uh the burger was all right like it's kind of like your standard burger that you would expect from um just any place that you would see on the street uh the natural hot chicken was actually a little bit above average so like those nice chicken tenders were great in there uh the dry heat from the nashville hot chick the the sauce and the seasoning was really good mixed with like the mayo but the fries were they're not even crinkle fries i don't know what that was about um the seasoning was the same as a nashville hot chicken i think um but they were it just tasted okay and then the mr b style fries were nothing special to me um you kind of just got a ton of mustard and ketchup all over your fries um a little bit of cheese that was like your normal american cheddar like laid out over it i don't know maybe somebody else might like it um but to me uh this wasn't anything special uh sorry mr beast but it's just kind of mediocre if you want to try it out it's like it's all right for a meal right so if you're not looking for anything too crazy you just like want to have a quick bite you want a burger you could go to this joint but aside from that like i wouldn't go out of my way to get it um although i did today so take a recommendation from me if you really want to try it go ahead but i to me there's nothing special if you pass by grab a bite but yeah just don't just don't go out of your way to get it so thanks for coming along for the ride uh feel free to subscribe to the channel drop a like it really helps out and leave a comment on what's a good burger joint um this one was just kind of mediocre i'm looking for something better what's better out there in toronto alright see you next time

like button for that youtube algorithm it honestly really helps out so today we're going to take a korean snack food tour we're going to three different spots and we're going to bring you along with us and everything you're going to see can be bought for less than 10 bucks so it's a real deal come along for the ride and let's get going [Music] so the first place we're going to try is roll this is a korean spot in north york and we got the korean sausage we got tapoke we got the tuna kimbap you can get as a combo or you can get them each separately if you get them all each separately they're like less than 10 bucks each if you get it as a combo i think it's total of like almost 16 bucks i'll put the prices in the descriptions like here ish somewhere on this side so roll is really known for having a lot of different korean street foods so they've been around north york for like ages now it's been like years and they've they've still been there still doing it very well and everything from their place is actually like really really great so first we got the tapoke it's like rice cakes uh fish cakes um all and mixed in with this uh korean spicy sauce it looks really good it's like warming to your heart when you're eating it uh let's take our first spice of this rice cake it's so nice and chewy it's not like hard in the middle it's so delicious the sauce while it is spicy and like it'll keep building as you're eating it but it's really good it's so flavorful and has like a really nice like it's like a sweet a sweet spicy sauce and one of my favorite parts of every dupoki is probably the fish cakes the fish cakes this is so good delicious it's so good so nice and it has like that that little bit of fish flavor that you get with the fish cakes and it's such a like a nice um addition to just having rice cakes like this is one of my favorite favorite korean dishes i love getting this wherever i go so next here we got the tuna kimbap you see this ginormous roll uh looks like it's filled with egg uh they got some carrots in there they got the pickled radish um and the tuna oh it's massive i don't know if i can get this all in one bite okay that was a major mouthful i'm sorry it took so long for me to talk again but there's so much um it's so nicely made the flavors work great it's really like light and refreshing kind of taste to it um it's not very heavy or like very creamy or anything it's very pure in that you're getting like the taste of the vegetables you're getting that pickle from the pickled radish and it works really nicely with that tuna um i've been eating this you easily eat this as like a light snack in the afternoon very easy to eat so what i hear is that a lot of koreans like to dip their kim pop into the tapoke sauce so i'm gonna do that and like let's see how this is i've never tried this actually um it's good there's adds a bit of sweetness to the roll and then a very slight hint of spicy you really don't get that spiciness when you dip it in but you get that sweetness and that actually works really well with the kimbap so this next one's called sunday and it's korean blood sausage with rice inside um and it comes with this salt on the side i think it's some salt and there's a little bit of like there's some sesame in there um some red stuff i'm not actually sure what that is so i'm being told it's pepper flakes um so let's dip it in let's see how it tastes it's really nice i'll be honest with you this isn't my favorite dish but it's it's good like you don't taste like even though it's a blood sausage you don't really taste any of that in it uh you mainly get like texture from the rice inside um i think maybe some clear glass noodles in here as well um and then you dip it with the salt and it adds like that really nice like salt salt and pepper flavor when you eat this there's actually like a fragrance from that blood but it's not like you know like sometimes you eat something that's blood it's like you taste kind of it kind of tastes irony this doesn't you get like a kind of meaty like a meat flavor coming out of it um and that mixes really nicely with like the the rice and the clear noodles our next snack place is called chongqin hot dogs these are korean hot dogs um they're very similar to uh your pogo sticks if you remember that from when you're a kid just like think back right now yeah those pogo sticks from when you were a kid this is just an adult version elevated to another level uh they're like absolutely delicious you go like god i try this place if you haven't tried this place you live in like the gta you live somewhere where you can have access to this you haven't tried it like you have to like you're missing out you've got to go try this so we got the mozzarella with the hot dog inside we got ramen chips covering the outside with some sugar and ketchup on it we also got the squid ink i think the inside is just the hot dog and then we got honey mustard and ketchup so i'm gonna try this one first it's so funny it comes like on on the on a chopstick can't even bite it this thing's like massive i'm having trouble figuring out how to how to attack it first so good so crispy so crunchy they have a really nice fried batter on the outside the ramen chips add a little bit of that crunch like a really big crunch actually not little and you hit that mozzarella in the middle oh let me let me try to get you that that cheese pull when you get cheese pull like that you know it's official it's great if you don't get a cheeseball like man they're using the wrong type of cheese this is some proper mozzarella so it's time to try squid ink i don't think squidding actually as much of a flavor but like let's find out um tastes just as good as the other one this one actually has mozzarella too i didn't know that um the honey mustard actually really good adds a really nice flavor it's like nice and sweet um but yeah and take a great look inside yeah nice batter cheese like how could you ask for anything more just wait till we get to the hot dog party the hot dogs are amazing too and now an asmr break in three two one so lastly we went to sunny dragon this place apparently has really good cha changmin which is like um a black bean based sauce um mixed with noodles it has like onions in it um sometimes it has meat or sometimes that seafood but overall we just we got this one and i think there's only there's a bit of meat inside some meat and some onions with the black bean paste or black bean sauce and it has like these noodles these really chewy noodles so let's let's take our first bite of this has a really nice flavor it's nice and light um overall there's a lot of other places that make changing man but they make it way too heavy on that black bean sauce it's not as nice inflate nice light and delicate in flavor this one is which i think is real a really good thing um and then you have that meat inside you get the texture from like the onions some places just stack it up with i think it becomes like too oily too heavy of a sauce and it's not as enjoyable to eat it makes you feel like really bloated and stuffed after but this one i can see myself eating it like all like i can finish the entire thing and not feel too too heavy um the other thing i gotta mention about this place this seven bucks this seven bucks um you go downtown you try eating at other places probably paying like 13 15 bucks for the same thing so i mean like this is a deal a really great deal you gotta try this it also comes with some pickled radish very common uh side dish and it's nice and refreshing after when you eat these cuts do like the the creaminess of the black bean paste we just finished everything from roll chun chun rice hot dog and sunny dragon everything was absolutely delicious and for under 10 bucks you can't get that value in many other places so i highly recommend you check all three of these places out um the rice dog was so good it's the perfect amount of bun to sausage ratio um comparing to to a hot dog hot dogs suck honestly there's so much bun not enough hot dog this is the complete opposite you got that super crunchy it outside you got the mozzarella or or the hot dog in the middle you got that really nice sauce for the chajang man from sunny dragon you got a super delicious tapoki that's a little bit spicy but also so nicely sweet and creamy so check out all these places i'll link them all in the description box below so you can also take this food tour if you want to or if you want to have just one of these snacks you can go and check them out but thanks for coming along for the ride remember to hit that subscribe button hit the like button helps me out a ton and until next time

    "title": "BEST Toronto Signature Pizza Review ft. NBA Top Shot Unboxing",
    "description": "We went on an incredible signature pizza tour visiting 4 restaurants in Downtown Toronto. We went to Queen Margherita Pizza, Blondies Pizza, Conzo's Pizza and 8 Mile Detroit Style Pizza. Queen Margherita was definitely the best with their flavorful dough, sweet tomatoes and creamy mozzarella cheese. Watch through the entire video to hear my thoughts on all these pizza joints.\n\nThe 2021 All-Star Ga",

    "transcript": "i don't even think it's like significantly better than the dominoes hey what's going on welcome back to phil's food review i'm here with my boys og pk boy and nick and we're out here trying to do a signature pizza challenge so we're just gonna go around to different places around the city get their signature pizzas and we will review it for you [Music] got queen margarita pizza the tomatoes are really sweet cheese is nice and creamy a bit of olive oil on top and the crust is perfect this is like the best margarita pizza in the entire city maybe aside from like gilaweta possibly like that's the only one that like really rivals this to me like this is what i expect from a margarita pizza like a floppy across not so hard and like crunchy but soft and chewy and then you get like sweetness from the tomatoes obviously you get like a nice like creamy cheese like sometimes the cheese tastes like plastic and i hate that because obviously cheese isn't supposed to taste like plastic we got blondie's pizza uh you can't miss the building it's like all pink that's all you can see the boxes are pink so when you get in there uh we ordered the pizza and it took a long time so just be aware of that every single place i guess because it's a friday night that's our fault takes about like 45 minutes to like an hour and a half depends on the store but this place is really popular tons of people were there picking up pizza so we're gonna try a slice and see how it is so we got the cold drink hot girl pizza they said it was one of their most popular ones it's pretty good we're off the bat get tons of that pepperoni and like it's super crunchy there's a crunchy top to the pepperoni you get some of that heat from the jalapenos it's pretty good the flavor is all right it's not bad flavor and the crust is done pretty nicely too so overall it's like a pretty it's a pretty dope pizza i don't know if it is my favorite though it's just a decently good pizza so it came with some of that dip i think this is something more spicy maybe it looks like a pretty creamy sauce like chipotle sauce look at cheesy maybe chipotle it's a really thick sauce but i kind of like the sauce how how would you rate it i i'd say it's like it's okay it's like a pretty decent pizza i wouldn't order it again though um i could see some other people liking this a lot just because of the toppings um and then the sauce with it but to me this isn't like my favorite pizza um i probably won't order this again honestly going in i didn't know what to expect from body though but because i saw it at like blue quartz activations were pretty low honestly um like this to me is like a franchise pizza this is like what was it 17 bucks yeah 17 bucks for this pizza for a 13 inch yeah for 13 inch for 13 a piece though and i i don't even think it's like significantly better than the domino's like the crust is definitely better than like a domino's or pizza pizza crust 100 dough is better ingredients may be slightly better so maybe like 13 pizza 14 pizza you know what goes really great with pizza some sports and we're going to open up a solid mba pack for you right now all right so we're going to do we're going to do an opening of the all-star game drop from top shot so got it today let's see what it is [Music] [Music] the next one we got is konzo's pizza and i think they gave us a rose is what they said it was um and like first right off the bat like we're looking at the pizza and you see there's like a giant like layer of oil on top i don't know how that is once we're gonna eat it and like the cheese smell is so pungent it's such a strong like strong smell to it let's see if we actually like this one bad huh you like the sauce folks we actually get a lot of the flavor from the parsley i think the cheese is really strong it does like the smell i think it's like a blend of cheeses it looks like there's like mozzarella maybe a bit of cheddar even and parmesan um but it tastes really nice it's just like a really strong and punier flavor from the the cheese uh decent flavor from like the parmesan i mean not the parmesan the parsley on top um and it's actually not as oily as i thought it'd be um it there's definitely still like a little like a layer of like oil on top um but it's not like the typeware is like dripping out like you know some of that cafeteria pizza yeah cafeteria pizza just like you could take a entire like roll of paper towel and try to soak it up and still be too much oil on top it supposed to be a rose sauce but i don't get any flavor of sauce in here i just get straight cheese maybe the cheese is just that strong all i get is like straight cheese from this so console's pizza is like like nick said it was like a lot of cheese and a lot of crust i like hardly get any tomato out of it even though it's a rose pizza um and the crust is kind of like kind of solid i don't really there's like not really much flavor coming out of the crust it's just like it's just kind of there it's all across that i would enjoy eating so this last one that we got eight mile detroit style pizza and i've also had another one another detroit style pizza thing was called defendants that one was really good so i have high expectations for this so but they only told us that their signature was the pepperoni so i mean i don't know how many places have a signature pepperoni pizza but right off the bat when you're like when you feel it when you touch it it's like really heavy and like super oily uh to the touch uh the cheese is like nice and stringy which i like um got that cheese pull and there's a lot a lot of uh pepperonis on top of this dude i felt like that mouthful of oil the cheese although it's like okay there's like a really thick layer of this cheese and it's not like the not the best quality of cheese either you know how like some cheese can be like almost plasticky it's kind of well the feeling i get from it and like the tomato sauce is like normal like very regular tomato sauce with basil in it it's detroit detroit pizzas like a deep dish type style pizza so like you would expect the crust the bottom around the around the pizza to be like kind of crunchy this is just like straight soggy because of the oil dude after i took a bite i felt like i just got like i just i felt like i just put on lip gloss as you can see some of the pepperonis are even burnt so that just like takes away from the pizza even more the crust has an okay crunch to it but overall this pizza doesn't do it for me the other place was way way better like way better i'll go to that place every single time over this one for sure all right so we finished eating all these pizzas and like our overall thoughts are all the same we all like queen margarita the best has the best crust has a lot of flavor it's nice and chewy it has a great sauce to it as well the mozzarella is nice and overall it's just such a great pizza for the second one uh we went blondies right so blondie's was pretty good it's very popular i want to try some of their other pizzas the one we got was just like it was pretty good but i didn't think it was on that tier that like demanded the same kind of popularity that we saw from the shop the third one was kondo's pizza um and honestly i didn't think i like really tasted any of the sauce in there it was just a ton of cheese and bread although like the layer of bread is really thin um overall the flavor of the pizza wasn't like the greatest i thought it was like pretty decent but i honestly wouldn't recommend it myself i wouldn't recommend you go there it's just like my opinion on that so the last one went to eight mile i would definitely not recommend it uh it was way too early i felt like unhealthy about the second as long like it was in my hands i already felt it was unhealthy um nothing about it was that great the sauce was like fairly mediocre same with the same with the cheese and that pepperoni some of them being burnt leaves a bad taste in your mouth i would definitely not recommend this place but overall i would highly recommend that you get queen margherita pizza it's probably like one of the best margarita pizzas in the city i've had eight different i think eight different or like six different margarita pizzas around the city and this one is definitely one of the best uh this and giluetta are like the best margarita pizzas and overall pizzas in general um but if you enjoyed the video leave a like and if you want to see more food adventures so that you know where to put your hard-earned money to subscribe to the channel i'd really appreciate it so until the next adventure peace [Music] you",
