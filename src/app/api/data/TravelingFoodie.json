    "transcript": "[Music] hey guys I'm walking along Queen Street West right now and I'm here to check out mother it's a cocktail bar and it's been named number 37 in North America's best 50 Bars by World 50 best group I can't wait to check it out it's been on my list for a while so I'm very excited [Music] and what's cool is they also give you a chocolate on the side to pair with the cocktail [Music] this is the Cameron Bridge Redemption it's part of their tanker region number 10 menu it has green watermelon celery Rose and more cherry [Music] this is unique is they use gen instead of Campari and they Infuse it with coffee bean so you will get some coffee paste LGH [Music] [Music] Ana [Music] hey guys mother is so good I highly recommend like the all the drinks I had were really good my top cocktail was the visions of Ooka and then I also really love the avogato martini if you love espresso Martini I highly recommend that the food I was also really surprised it was really good my favorites were the jerk chicken karage which is very unique a nice twist to jerk chicken and chicken karage and I also really love the Koji age Tartar and they gave a really good portion so it's good to share I can totally see how they made the North America's 50 best bars it's really creative drinks and really really good place I love the vice as well they have live music on Tuesday and Sunday as well so if you're into that check them out on those days okay so I'm still hungry so this is part two of dinner I'm here at Henry's it's a wine bar I've never been here before so I'm curious to try it's literally walking distance from Modern [Music] foreign bar I figured they had to get the wine this one is a Chilean I use Vanessa wine from the Pedro para Vineyards [Music] where she's fully and marinated in Florida [Music] this is Bubba's hot Fried Chicken so this is the grilled flat iron steak what really caught my eye on the fish is cow soy as a sauce which I find very unique there's crispy noodles on top and bok choy so this is the syrup it has white chocolate brownies coffee semifreddo and salted rice [Music] hey guys that was such a great dinner at Henry's I can see why they are Michelin recommended so they're actually in the Michelin guide I just noticed the sign on the restaurant I don't know that going into it so it's a good thing I ended up eating there the dishes are very unique I really really like the real flat iron steak because of the color soy twist that they added the bluefin tuna was also really good expect a more higher higher end pricing especially since I just came from mother so for example the church chicken garaga was 16 for like a lot of pieces whereas here the hot chicken was like twelve dollars for two pieces of the same size so that's the big difference between minor dining at Henry's versus us like mother but overall really enjoy my crawl and I hope you enjoyed watching this video if you want to see more food crawls in Toronto please like And subscribe and watch this next video right here",

    "transcript": "foreign hey guys come to join me on another Toronto food tour this time I'm checking out the annex neighborhood [Music] so I am here at Detroit noodle bowl it's located in Toronto with Annex and it's very near battery station so once you're off the station it's pretty much right at the intersection it's a new restaurant in Toronto open around three months ago I think so I thought I'd check it out I can't wait to try so I got there I eat handmade noodle soup with these and I also got the boiled dumpling with chili oil also spicy let's see how good it is [Music] [Music] that was such a great meal at such when noodle bowl highly recommend the handmade noodles it was perfectly Al Dente with a nice bounce the soup was so flavorful it wasn't spicy though I was very surprised so both are chili oil and the soup even though it looked very red it actually wasn't spicy to me I didn't even really need to drink water while I ate both dishes so I highly recommend trying to get the spicy because it's really not that spicy but because you got spicy you get the chili which means you get a more flavorful soup my only complaint really was the beef it was kind of tough and chewy so I wish they use a better cut or cook it a little better so it's more tender but otherwise it was a nice bowl of noodle soup so I also learned that they actually have their first location in Mississauga so this location at the annex is actually the first location in Toronto but the second in Canada The Boiled dumplings is also good it was nothing special it was like your typical dumplings but the chili oil it came with was very flavorful it also wasn't that spicy so I had leftover soup from the handmade Noodle and what I did was I added my dumplings to the soup to give it more flavor and then I added chili oil onto the soup as well so highly recommend doing that so I'm heading to my next stop and it's going to be Isabella's Mochi donut Boutique [Music] so I ended up getting the Uber to say the lecture as well as the Hong Kong milk tea coffee so I love that their flavors are more Asian inspired and I think it changes as well seasonally so can't wait to try so they don't allow dining at the store there's even a thing that says that so I was wandering around trying to look for a place to sit and eat the donut yeah those are some pretty good Mochi Donuts between the two flavors I prefer the Hong Kong milk tea coffee because I find it's less sweet and you have a nice coffee head and the Pea here as well the Uber was kind of sweet for me even though you do taste the Ube and I think it's because that made it really sweet For Me overall really Tasty Donuts I personally still think I prefer the ones I had in Japan I felt the ones in Japan had a nice crust like it was sort of crispy crust on the outside but then Mochi gooeyness and chewiness inside whereas here I felt it was consistently chewy all throughout even the crust and now that I've done with the syrup I kind of want to wash it down because it was still sweet I ate two Donuts so I'm gonna see if I can check out a cafe so I'm here checking out Russell and still Cafe it's one of the best cafes here in Toronto especially in the annex area I've been here multiple times before so I'm just back here to try a new drink that they haven't tried before I've had their pan done and Ube and potato latte before but I do want to try their Vietnamese coffee at the Vietnamese coffee was really good you get your choice between hot and Ice I would normally go for hot you get a stronger coffee flavor but since it was so hot today I ended up with the ice and you also get your choice between regular condensed milk or coconut condensed milk and I got the coconut water really tasty and really hit the spot since I was trying to wash down the sweetness from the donuts so I am here on my last stop which is chica's chicken it was the perfect sign for me because I've been wanting to visit chica's chicken after learning about it in the Michelin guy they got good man for their national hot fried chicken and their original location is in the junction which is kind of far and hard to keep DC into so when I was just walking around the annex and looking at Google Maps I saw there's a chica's chicken here and it's the second location so that is my science so I'm here right now on for my last stop [Music] so I got the OG bite and it was really really tasty very juicy meat and the breading was very crispy I actually think I would like the OG bites more than like a bone-in chicken even though a lot of therapy said to get the bone and chicken because I feel like the OG bites have a nice balance of like the crispy skin and meat a good ratio I got the medium level and it was nice and spicy not crazy spicy but you still get the kick and it was very flavorful one thing I would point out though is that I did find a bone while I was eating my bite so keep a look out if you are getting that I definitely do want to come back to try their OG chicken sandwich as well as their crispy waffle fries which a lot of people have raved about so I'll definitely be back hey guys I'm doing this thing where I'm actually doing the review after I've left the restaurant I've always found it kind of awkward to be sharing my thoughts good or bad while I I'm in the restaurant where the other people can hear me I always had to stop while I eat just to share my thoughts I find this is just better overalls let me know if you prefer this kind of format I hope you enjoyed eating with me in the annex neighborhood if you like this kind of Toronto food tour let me know in the comments below which neighborhood I should try next and be sure to like subscribe and watch this next video right here for more Toronto contest",

    "title": "$20 Toronto Chinatown FOOD CHALLENGE! 5 Cheap Eats Toronto Food Tour!",
    "description": "Looking for cheap eats in Toronto Chinatown? I went on a Toronto Chinatown Food Crawl doing the $20 Food Challenge! Toronto Chinatown in Dundas and Spadina is one of the largest Chinatowns in North America and one of the oldest in Toronto! I was on a mission to do the $20 food challenge in Toronto Chinatown to eat as much food as I can as I do this food tour. Here's where I went in Toronto China",

    "transcript": "hey guys so i'm here in chinatown where i'll be spending 20 dollars to eat my way around the area [Music] hey guys this is raymond from traveling foodie and i'm here in front of chinatown located in dundas and spadina though there are several chinatowns in the city this is the main chinatown when people say toronto chinatown chinatown has a lot of different asian restaurants not just restaurants but also like nice specialty stores and bakery so i'm gonna be maximizing the 20 to try to get as much mileage i can visiting different places that i've tried and loved but also new places i've never tried before [Music] so our first stop is juicy dumplings they are actually for me one of the best value xiao long power places you can get in chinatown so you can get six pieces of these soup dumplings just for 3.99 at such a great value people have different ways of eating xiaolongbao but like they didn't provide any spoons because it was pretty crowded so we ended up leaving the place and finding random place to just sit shop so i like taking the top off first and then sucking the soup from it i know some people just put everything in their mouth or using a spoon but i do it the top way it's so good lots of soup inside the wrapper isn't that thick so you get a nice balance with the pork and the soup [Music] so now i'm here at hong kong dim sum house so they're pretty unique we're in they're a bakery but they also have a fast casual dim sum section where you can order different symptoms and you can get it to go and come to these tables to eat them so i got the beef ball so this is 4.49 so initially i wanted to get the deep fried shrimp dumplings but for 4.99 but it was sold out already so i ended up with this to fit the 20 limit so let's try so they are much smaller than what you would normally get in denson restaurant but the pace is actually there it's actually pretty good it's just smaller but you can't beat this since it's very [Music] so our third stop is and they're actually the og for ban meat in toronto so they're one of the oldest and they're also one of the cheapest so i got the barbecue part on this spicy but see how massive that is lots of filling the pork is underneath and it got spicy as well so let's try so you can see the amount of barbecue pork they have inside there's also the pate the liver patty that they use it's so flavorful you can taste the barbecue flavor as well plus i love cilantro but if you don't like it you can ask them to remove it so talk about inflation um before kovit when i went here last time it was still like 4.50 for for this and now it's six dollars it's still a really good sandwich and institution to visit in chinatown so here's what i got so far so it's a 3.99 for the juicy dumplings 4.29 for the beast ball at hong kong island district and it's six dollars for this one so 3.99 plus 4.29 is around let's tax it's like 9 35 something and then this is tax included already for six dollars the running total right now is 15.36 so i still have around four dollars and 54 cents to use up so let's see what i can do with that [Music] so our third stop is machine bakery so they is basically your traditional chinese bakery so you can get the buns tarts and stuff like that so i got a pineapple and pork bun and it's one dollar with tax already so let's try it's nice and fluffy you get the crispiness from the the pineapple part and the bottom part is really moist and nice so two bites in i'm still not on the pork side so i'll keep eating until the pork so we made it to the pork the pork filling is on the safer side not too sweet but i wish it had more of a like a grilled barbecue pork paste but still really good i really like the pineapple bun that it came with so right now i was around 4.65 cents left and then this is a dollar so i still have around 2.65 cents left so let's find some more places [Music] we just checked out the fifth stop in our list which was ding dong pastry so they're known for really really cheap chinese pastry so they have your usual buns um pineapple buns or steamed buns but they also have some interesting ones like this peanut butter sticky rice for 40 cents and it's very cheap and then then this one here is the tarot pastry for dollar twenty that's included already for both of these so it ended up being dollar sixty for both so i'm gonna try the sticky rice first so chewy and you can see the peanut butter inside i really really love this if you love like if you like mochi that's that's very chewy look how gooey this is like oh so so it turns out even though like i thought i was taking peanut butter sticky ball it's actually sesame inside but it's still really really good especially if you like sesame base it's roasted inside so now i'm trying the taro pastry i didn't see this a lot in the other bakeries we visited that's why i'm very curious and i love taro as well so it's actually a bowl of taro inside that's so cool i guess that's why it's a dollar twenty i was initially wondering why it was so expensive for a small piece of taro balls but yeah it's pure mashed taro inside so this can be very heavy because of this pure mashed taro inside so now i'm starting to feel full because of this but yeah if you love taro definitely try this [Music] so i had around two dollars and ten cents left so what i did was i went back to hong kong island dim sum house because i found they had one of the cheaper hong kong milk tea so this is the hot hong kong milky it's a dollar eighty for the large they didn't have the small which was dollar fifty so it's dollar eighty plus tax which is two two dollars and three cents so i ended up spending everything i had today totaling to 19.98 something i got it so close to twenty dollars so what a perfect day to spend the twenty dollars maximizing it as much as i can i hope you enjoy this video and if you find it useful please like and subscribe thank you [Music]",

This cluster is not only filled with Korean businesses and restaurants but also general Asian spots.",

So we're now here at our first stop which is chengdu wonton and they're known for sichuan dishes as well as a wide variety of wontons that you can try so let's check it out. I just finished the tai chi wonton and they're actually really delicious very flavorful very spicy though so that's why i'm speaking here now because i was coughing a while ago but it's very flavorful it had like cilantro, even baby bamboos from Fujian actually which is quite interesting. The soup is very flavorful there's potato noodles, beef and the pork wonton so try it! I'm trying this blueberry and cheese dorayaki from suntea. So our next stop is egg club and they specialize in korean style sandwiches and i'm trying the meat lovers which has smoked sausage patty, chipotle mayo, bacon and their special egg club sauce so they have their own version of hash brown and it's like hash brown base but there's also some potato so the base is nice and crispy this filling is kind of savory and sweet at the same time i don't care much about the filling so honestly i would still rather have mcdonald's hashbrowns over this. This is the meat lover sandwich and you can see the sausage the bacon the egg and the sauce. So i got the white dragon roll this is the roll i've tried like years ago and i really love it it has torched scallop on top with crab meat, shrimp tempura avocado and cucumber in a roll with spicy mayo. The recent food trend in toronto are korean hot dogs so i'm now here at arirang hot dog. They're actually a chain from korea and i'm trying their mozzarella cheese and half sausage hot dog. So i added cheddar cheese sauce, hot chili and honey butter so let's try. okay so it took some time but i finally reached the hot dog part so i kind of wish that they mixed the hot dog and mozzarella together instead of having top half being cheese and bottom half being hot dog because it becomes too much i personally would like to have hot dog and cheese in one bite and the hot dog part is much shorter than the cheese part as well. So our last stop for this food crawl is the good luck hong kong cafe which just opened recently in yonge and finch area and it's normally very packed with lineup so we're lucky that we are able to snag a spot. So let's check it out! hey guys Jon Mr. Dim Sum here. I've been here many many times and for a good reason because i really like this place so definitely come check it out. This is a big chicken cutlet with black truffle and cheese on rice. We tried the deep fried wonton which is a new item. Salted egg french toast, deep-fried milk, Hong Kong style curry fish ball",
