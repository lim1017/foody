friend bill if you remember him who likes old school toronto hates all the new school bike lanes anything fancy life um he said there's a great restaurant anyways i went to take a look at the oven while i waited i saw it look like a good wood-fired oven my man making the pizza was wearing a john's a bleaker shirt this man wearing a jawns of bleaker oh molly look at that shirt oh you can't set the bar any higher and he's like yeah when we developed this place i went to all the pizzerias that i heard about that you talked about and tried to base it so now my my expectations like i tend to like what you like is through the roof i mean john's bleak is a hall of fame first ballot one of my favorites i've ever had barcelona that was awesome touchy feel you know personal space right touched me like 18 times in a minute so here we go um konzo a little oily greasy in there i can smell it also really cool the guy that bricks around the oven he he basically his old high school was torn down or something he took all the bricks from his old high school which is right around the corner and built the oven that's a story that's story time i'm not into the me too [ __ ] but i just i couldn't me too the [ __ ] of that guy one biter knows the rules if this holds its crisp we got something it did not let's see what we got did not hold the crisp sometimes smells good smells distinctive let's see what we got here kanzos [Music] you know what there's more crisp than what it would look like with that flop like you could kind of probably hear it a little bit great undercarriage distinctive this is way more flavorful than john's a bleeker and how i say that i generally like clean and simple like i don't like to necessarily be overwhelmed with what i would consider sometimes artisan pizza this tends to be more on the artisan side if you ask me you did say preferred the cauli over john's you know what before i score i'm going to give this the benefit of a cool because sometimes this is so hot out of the oven i was waiting to get the flop you got to let it firm up that's just an insider trick that's a little inside of trading in the pizza world by the way there's pizza places like what kind of i've never been to cheetos what type of maniac would go there over here i just know you're a maniac to go to cheetahs all right let's see if it firmed up still no score so i still have
